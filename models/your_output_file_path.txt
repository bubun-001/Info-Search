Qualified and experienced Texas faculty were involved throughout the development process, and the textbooks were reviewed extensively to ensure effectiveness and usability in each course. Reviewers considered each resource's clarity, accuracy, student support, assessment rigor and appropriateness, alignment to TEKS, and overall quality. Their invaluable suggestions provided the basis for continually improved material and helped to certify that the books are ready for use. The writers and reviewers also considered common course issues, effective teaching strategies, and student engagement to provide instructors and students with useful, supportive content and drive effective learning experiences.lso considered common course issues, effective teaching strategies, and student engagement to provide instructors and students with useful, supportive content and drive effective learning experiences.


Physics presents physical laws, research, concepts, and skills in a logical and engaging progression that should be familiar
to most physics faculty. The textbook begins with a general introduction to physics and scientific processes, which is followed by several chapters on motion and Newton's laws. After mechanics, the students will move through thermodynamics, waves and sound, and light and optics.

Figure 1.1 Galaxies, such as the Andromeda galaxy pictured here, are immense in size. The small blue spots in this photo are also galaxies. The same physical laws apply to objects as large as galaxies or objects as small as atoms. The laws of physics are, therefore, surprisingly few in number. (NASA, JPL-Caltech, P.

INTRODUCTION Take a look at the image above of the Andromeda Galaxy (Figure 1.1), which contains billions of stars. This galaxy is the nearest one to our own galaxy (the Milky Way) but is still a staggering 2.5 million light years from Earth. (A light year is a measurement of the distance light travels in a year.) Yet, the primary force that affects the movement of stars within Andromeda is the same force that we contend with here on Earth—namely, gravity.a measurement of the distance light travels in a year.)

Think about all of the technological devices that you use on a regular basis. Computers, wireless internet, smart phones, tablets, global positioning system (GPS), MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Next, think about the most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above their tracks, invisibility cloaks that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight diseased cells in our bodies.

Physics is a branch of science. The word science comes from a Latin word that means having knowledge, and refers the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on objective evidence determined through observation and experimentation. A key requirement of any scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is that it must be testable; one must be able to devise and conduct an experimental investigation that either supports or refutes the explanation. It is important to note that some questions fall outside the realm of science precisely because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically testable. This need for objective evidence helps define the investigative process scientists follow, which will be described later in this chapter.This need for objective evidence helps define the investigative process scientists follow, which will be described later in this chapter.

Physics is the science aimed at describing the fundamental aspects of our universe. This includes what things are in it, what properties of those things are noticeable, and what processes those things or their properties undergo. In simpler terms, physics attempts to describe the basic mechanisms that make our universe behave the way it does. For example, consider a smart phone (Figure 1.2). Physics describes how electric current interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. When you use a GPS device in a vehicle, it utilizes these physics relationships to determine the travel time from one location to another.When you use a GPS device in a vehicle, it utilizes these physics relationships to determine the travel time from one location to another.

As our technology evolved over the centuries, physics expanded into many branches. Ancient peoples could only study things that they could see with the naked eye or otherwise experience without the aid of scientific equipment. This included the study of kinematics, which is the study of moving objects. For example, ancient people often studied the apparent motion of objects in the sky, such as the sun, moon, and stars. This is evident in the construction of prehistoric astronomical observatories, such as Stonehenge in England (shown in Figure 1.3).This is evident in the construction of prehistoric astronomical observatories, such as Stonehenge in England (shown in Figure 1.3).

It functions as an ancient astronomical observatory, with certain rocks in the monument aligning with the position of the sun during the summer and winter solstices. Other rocks align with the rising and setting of the moon during certain days of the year. (Citypeek, Wikimedia Commons)(Citypeek, Wikimedia Commons)

Ancient people also studied statics and dynamics, which focus on how objects start moving, stop moving, and change speed and direction in response to forces that push or pull on the objects. This early interest in kinematics and dynamics allowed humans to invent simple machines, such as the lever, the pulley, the ramp, and the wheel. These simple machines were gradually
combined and integrated to produce more complicated machines, such as wagons and cranes. Machines allowed humans to gradually do more work more effectively in less time, allowing them to create larger and more complicated buildings and structures, many of which still exist today from ancient times.llowed humans to gradually do more work more effectively in less time, allowing them to create larger and more complicated buildings and structures, many of which still exist today from ancient times.

As technology advanced, the branches of physics diversified even more. These include branches such as acoustics, the study of sound, and optics, the study of the light. In 1608, the invention of the telescope by a Germany spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, led to huge breakthroughs in astronomy-the study of objects or phenomena in space. One year later, in 1609, Galileo Galilei began the first studies of the solar system and the universe using a telescope. During the Renaissance era, Isaac Newton used observations made by Galileo to construct his three laws of motion. These laws were the standard for studying kinematics and dynamics even today.These laws were the standard for studying kinematics and dynamics even today.

Another major branch of physics is thermodynamics, which includes the study of thermal energy and the transfer of heat. James Prescott Joule, an English physicist, studied the nature of heat and its relationship to work. Joule's work helped lay the foundation for the first of three laws of thermodynamics that describe how energy in our universe is transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to another. Studies in thermodynamics were motivated by the need to make engines more efficient, keep people safe from the elements, and preserve food.Studies in thermodynamics were motivated by the need to make engines more efficient, keep people safe from the elements, and preserve food.

The $18^{ {th }}$ and $19^{ {th }}$ centuries also saw great strides in the study of electricity and magnetism. Electricity involves the study of electric charges and their movements. Magnetism had long ago been noticed as an attractive force between a magnetized object and a metal like iron, or between the opposite poles (North and South) of two magnetized objects. In 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted showed that electric currents create magnetic fields. In 1831, English inventor Michael Faraday showed that moving a wire through a magnetic field could induce an electric current. These studies led to the inventions of the electric motor and electric generator, which revolutionized human life by bringing electricity and magnetism into our machines.These studies led to the inventions of the electric motor and electric generator, which revolutionized human life by bringing electricity and magnetism into our machines.

The end of the $19^{ {th }}$ century saw the discovery of radioactive substances by the French scientists Marie and Pierre Curie. Nuclear physics involves studying the nuclei of atoms, the source of nuclear radiation. In the $20^{ {th }}$ century, the study of nuclear physics eventually led to the ability to split the nucleus of an atom, a process called nuclear fission. This process is the basis for nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. Also, the field of quantum mechanics, which involves the mechanics of atoms and molecules, saw great strides during the $20^{ {th }}$ century as our understanding of atoms and subatomic particles increased (see below). quantum mechanics, which involves the mechanics of atoms and molecules, saw great strides during the $20^{ {th }}$ century as our understanding of atoms and subatomic particles increased (see below).

Early in the $20^{ {th }}$ century, Albert Einstein revolutionized several branches of physics, especially relativity. Relativity revolutionized our understanding of motion and the universe in general as described further in this chapter. Now, in the $21^{}$ century, physicists continue to study these and many other branches of physics.Now, in the $21^{}$ century, physicists continue to study these and many other branches of physics.

The word physics is thought to come from the Greek word phusis, meaning nature. The study of nature later came to be called natural philosophy. From ancient times through the Renaissance, natural philosophy encompassed many fields, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and medicine. Over the last few centuries, the growth of scientific knowledge has resulted in ever-increasing specialization and branching of natural philosophy into separate fields, with physics retaining the most basic facets. Physics, as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the $19^{ {th }}$ century, is called classical physics. Revolutionary discoveries starting at the beginning of the $20^{ {th }}$ century transformed physics from classical physics to modern physics.Revolutionary discoveries starting at the beginning of the $20^{ {th }}$ century transformed physics from classical physics to modern physics.

Classical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under the following conditions: (1) matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1 percent of the speed of light, (2) the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and (3) only weak gravity, such as that generated by Earth, can be involved. Very small objects, such as atoms and molecules, cannot be adequately explained by classical physics. These three conditions apply to almost all of everyday experience. As a result, most aspects of classical physics should make sense on an intuitive level.As a result, most aspects of classical physics should make sense on an intuitive level.

Many laws of classical physics have been modified during the $20^{ {th }}$ century, resulting in revolutionary changes in technology, society, and our view of the universe. As a result, many aspects of modern physics, which occur outside of the range of our everyday experience, may seem bizarre or unbelievable. So why is most of this textbook devoted to classical physics? There are
two main reasons. The first is that knowledge of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics. The second reason is that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances.The second reason is that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances.

Modern physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By examining how two observers moving relative to each other would see the same phenomena, Einstein devised radical new ideas about time and space. He came to the startling conclusion that the measured length of an object travelling at high speeds (greater than about one percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the same object measured at rest. Perhaps even more bizarre is the idea the time for the same process to occur is different depending on the motion of the observer. Time passes more slowly for an object travelling at high speeds. A trip to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut 4.5 Earth years if the ship travels near the speed of light. However, because time is slowed at higher speeds, the astronaut would age only 0.5 years during the trip. Einstein's ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous experiments.Einstein's ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous experiments.

Gravity, the force that holds us to Earth, can also affect time and space. For example, time passes more slowly on Earth's surface than for objects farther from the surface, such as a satellite in orbit. The very accurate clocks on global positioning satellites have to correct for this. They slowly keep getting ahead of clocks at Earth's surface. This is called time dilation, and it occurs because gravity, in essence, slows down time.This is called time dilation, and it occurs because gravity, in essence, slows down time.

Large objects, like Earth, have strong enough gravity to distort space. To visualize this idea, think about a bowling ball placed on a trampoline. The bowling ball depresses or curves the surface of the trampoline. If you rolled a marble across the trampoline, it would follow the surface of the trampoline, roll into the depression caused by the bowling ball, and hit the ball. Similarly, the Earth curves space around it in the shape of a funnel. These curves in space due to the Earth cause objects to be attracted to Earth (i.e., gravity).These curves in space due to the Earth cause objects to be attracted to Earth (i.e., gravity).

Because of the way gravity affects space and time, Einstein stated that gravity affects the space-time continuum, as illustrated in Figure 1.4. This is why time proceeds more slowly at Earth's surface than in orbit. In black holes, whose gravity is hundreds of times that of Earth, time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have stopped!In black holes, whose gravity is hundreds of times that of Earth, time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have stopped!

Figure 1.4 Einstein's theory of relativity describes space and time as an interweaved mesh. Large objects, such as a planet, distort space, causing objects to fall in toward the planet due to the action of gravity. Large objects also distort time, causing time to proceed at a slower rate near the surface of Earth compared with the area outside of the distorted region of space-time.Large objects also distort time, causing time to proceed at a slower rate near the surface of Earth compared with the area outside of the distorted region of space-time.

In summary, relativity says that in describing the universe, it is important to realize that time, space and speed are not absolute. Instead, they can appear different to different observers. Einstein's ability to reason out relativity is even more amazing because we cannot see the effects of relativity in our everyday lives.Einstein's ability to reason out relativity is even more amazing because we cannot see the effects of relativity in our everyday lives.

Quantum mechanics is the second major theory of modern physics. Quantum mechanics deals with the very small, namely, the subatomic particles that make up atoms. Atoms (Figure 1.5) are the smallest units of elements. However, atoms themselves are constructed of even smaller subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Quantum mechanics strives to
describe the properties and behavior of these and other subatomic particles. Often, these particles do not behave in the ways expected by classical physics. One reason for this is that they are small enough to travel at great speeds, near the speed of light.One reason for this is that they are small enough to travel at great speeds, near the speed of light.

At particle colliders (Figure 1.6), such as the Large Hadron Collider on the France-Swiss border, particle physicists can make subatomic particles travel at very high speeds within a 27 kilometers (17 miles) long superconducting tunnel. They can then study the properties of the particles at high speeds, as well as collide them with each other to see how they exchange energy. This has led to many intriguing discoveries such as the Higgs-Boson particle, which gives matter the property of mass, and antimatter, which causes a huge energy release when it comes in contact with matter.s led to many intriguing discoveries such as the Higgs-Boson particle, which gives matter the property of mass, and antimatter, which causes a huge energy release when it comes in contact with matter.

Physicists are currently trying to unify the two theories of modern physics, relativity and quantum mechanics, into a single, comprehensive theory called relativistic quantum mechanics. Relating the behavior of subatomic particles to gravity, time, and space will allow us to explain how the universe works in a much more comprehensive way.Relating the behavior of subatomic particles to gravity, time, and space will allow us to explain how the universe works in a much more comprehensive way.


You need not be a scientist to use physics. On the contrary, knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in nonscientific professions. For example, physics can help you understand why you shouldn't put metal in the microwave (Figure 1.7), why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and why a white roof helps keep the inside of a house cool. The operation of a car's ignition system, as well as the transmission of electrical signals through our nervous system, are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of the basic physics of electricity.r's ignition system, as well as the transmission of electrical signals through our nervous system, are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of the basic physics of electricity.

Physics is the foundation of many important scientific disciplines. For example, chemistry deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules. Not surprisingly, chemistry is rooted in atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are also applied physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of determining structural stability, acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling for buildings. Parts of geology, the study of nonliving parts of Earth, rely heavily on physics; including radioactive dating, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer across Earth's surface. Indeed, some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.Indeed, some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.

Physics also describes the chemical processes that power the human body. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as xrays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonic blood flow measurements (Figure 1.8). Medical therapy Physics also has many applications in biology, the study of life. For example, physics describes how cells can protect themselves using their cell walls and cell membranes (Figure 1.9). Medical therapy sometimes directly involves physics, such as in using X-rays to diagnose health conditions. Physics can also explain what we perceive with our senses, such as how the ears detect sound or the eye detects color.Physics can also explain what we perceive with our senses, such as how the ears detect sound or the eye detects color.

Both Voyagers have electrical power generators based on the decay of radioisotopes. These generators have served them for almost 40 years. Rosetta, on the other hand, is solar-powered.

Scientists often plan and carry out investigations to answer questions about the universe around us. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe, meaning that humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort. The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation. Science must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine or wish it to be.Science must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine or wish it to be.

We all are curious to some extent. We look around, make generalizations, and try to understand what we see. For example, we look up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become serious about exploring nature, we become more organized and formal in collecting and analyzing data. We attempt greater precision, perform controlled experiments (if we can), and write down ideas about how data may be organized. We then formulate models, theories, and laws based on the data we have collected, and communicate those results with others. This, in a nutshell, describes the scientific method that scientists employ to decide scientific issues on the basis of evidence from observation and experiment.This, in a nutshell, describes the scientific method that scientists employ to decide scientific issues on the basis of evidence from observation and experiment.

An investigation often begins with a scientist making an observation. The scientist observes a pattern or trend within the natural world. Observation may generate questions that the scientist wishes to answer. Next, the scientist may perform some research about the topic and devise a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a testable statement that describes how something in the natural world works. In essence, a hypothesis is an educated guess that explains something about an observation.In essence, a hypothesis is an educated guess that explains something about an observation.

Scientists may test the hypothesis by performing an experiment. During an experiment, the scientist collects data that will help them learn about the phenomenon they are studying. Then the scientists analyze the results of the experiment (that is, the data), often using statistical, mathematical, and/or graphical methods. From the data analysis, they draw conclusions. They may conclude that their experiment either supports or rejects their hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, the scientist usually goes on to test another hypothesis related to the first. If their hypothesis is rejected, they will often then test a new and different hypothesis in their effort to learn more about whatever they are studying.If their hypothesis is rejected, they will often then test a new and different hypothesis in their effort to learn more about whatever they are studying.

Scientific processes can be applied to many situations. Let's say that you try to turn on your car, but it will not start. You have just made an observation! You ask yourself, "Why won't my car start?" You can now use scientific processes to answer this question. First, you generate a hypothesis such as, "The car won't start because it has no gasoline in the gas tank." To test this hypothesis, you put gasoline in the car and try to start it again. If the car starts, then your hypothesis is supported by the experiment. If the car does not start, then your hypothesis is rejected. You will then need to think up a new hypothesis to test such as, "My car won't start because the fuel pump is broken." Hopefully, your investigations lead you to discover why the car won't start and enable you to fix it.o think up a new hypothesis to test such as, "My car won't start because the fuel pump is broken."

ModelingModeling

A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to study directly. Models can take the form of physical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations-computer graphics/animations. Models are tools that are especially useful in modern physics because they let us visualize phenomena that we normally cannot observe with our senses, such as very small objects or objects that move at high speeds. For example, we can understand the structure of an atom using models, despite the fact that no one has ever seen an atom with their own eyes. Models are always approximate, so they are simpler to consider than the real situation; the more complete a model is, the more complicated it must be. Models put the
intangible or the extremely complex into human terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize about.Models put the
intangible or the extremely complex into human terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize about.

Scientific models are constructed based on the results of previous experiments. Even still, models often only describe a phenomenon partially or in a few limited situations. Some phenomena are so complex that they may be impossible to model them in their entirety, even using computers. An example is the electron cloud model of the atom in which electrons are moving around the atom's center in distinct clouds (Figure 1.12), that represent the likelihood of finding an electron in different places. This model helps us to visualize the structure of an atom. However, it does not show us exactly where an electron will be within its cloud at any one particular time.However, it does not show us exactly where an electron will be within its cloud at any one particular time.

However, it cannot indicate exactly where an electron will be at any one time.However, it cannot indicate exactly where an electron will be at any one time.

As mentioned previously, physicists use a variety of models including equations, physical models, computer simulations, etc. For example, three-dimensional models are often commonly used in chemistry and physics to model molecules. Properties other than appearance or location are usually modelled using mathematics, where functions are used to show how these properties relate to one another. Processes such as the formation of a star or the planets, can also be modelled using computer simulations. Once a simulation is correctly programmed based on actual experimental data, the simulation can allow us to view processes that happened in the past or happen too quickly or slowly for us to observe directly. In addition, scientists can also run virtual experiments using computer-based models. In a model of planet formation, for example, the scientist could alter the amount or type of rocks present in space and see how it affects planet formation.In a model of planet formation, for example, the scientist could alter the amount or type of rocks present in space and see how it affects planet formation.

Scientists use models and experimental results to construct explanations of observations or design solutions to problems. For example, one way to make a car more fuel efficient is to reduce the friction or drag caused by air flowing around the moving car. This can be done by designing the body shape of the car to be more aerodynamic, such as by using rounded corners instead of sharp ones. Engineers can then construct physical models of the car body, place them in a wind tunnel, and examine the flow of air around the model. This can also be done mathematically in a computer simulation. The air flow pattern can be analyzed for regions smooth air flow and for eddies that indicate drag. The model of the car body may have to be altered slightly to produce the smoothest pattern of air flow (i.e., the least drag). The pattern with the least drag may be the solution to increasing fuel efficiency of the car. This solution might then be incorporated into the car design.This solution might then be incorporated into the car design.

A scientific law is a description of a pattern in nature that is true in all circumstances that have been studied. That is, physical laws are meant to be universal, meaning that they apply throughout the known universe. Laws are often also concise, whereas theories are more complicated. A law can be expressed in the form of a single sentence or mathematical equation. For example, Newton's second law of motion, which relates the motion of an object to the force applied $(F)$, the mass of the object $(m)$, and the object's acceleration (a), is simply stated using the equatione, Newton's second law of motion, which relates the motion of an object to the force applied $(F)$, the mass of the object $(m)$, and the object's acceleration (a), is simply stated using the equation

Scientific ideas and explanations that are true in many, but not all situations in the universe are usually called principles. An example is Pascal's principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or gases. However, the distinction between laws and principles is sometimes not carefully made in science.However, the distinction between laws and principles is sometimes not carefully made in science.

A theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by much scientific evidence and verified multiple times by multiple researchers. While many people confuse theories with educated guesses or hypotheses, theories have withstood more rigorous testing and verification than hypotheses.While many people confuse theories with educated guesses or hypotheses, theories have withstood more rigorous testing and verification than hypotheses.

As a closing idea about scientific processes, we want to point out that scientific laws and theories, even those that have been supported by experiments for centuries, can still be changed by new discoveries. This is especially true when new technologies emerge that allow us to observe things that were formerly unobservable. Imagine how viewing previously invisible objects with a
microscope or viewing Earth for the first time from space may have instantly changed our scientific theories and laws! What discoveries still await us in the future? The constant retesting and perfecting of our scientific laws and theories allows our knowledge of nature to progress. For this reason, many scientists are reluctant to say that their studies prove anything. By saying support instead of prove, it keeps the door open for future discoveries, even if they won't occur for centuries or even millennia.By saying support instead of prove, it keeps the door open for future discoveries, even if they won't occur for centuries or even millennia.

To answer these questions, they make measurements with various instruments (e.g., meter stick, balance, stopwatch, etc.).mple, how big is an object? How much mass does it have? How far did it travel?

The measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for long distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way (Figure 1.13).Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way (Figure 1.13).

There are two major systems of units used in the world: SI units (acronym for the French Le Système International d'Unités, also known as the metric system), and English units (also known as the imperial system). English units were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire. Today, the United States is the only country that still uses English units extensively. Virtually every other country in the world now uses the metric system, which is the standard system agreed upon by scientists and mathematicians.Virtually every other country in the world now uses the metric system, which is the standard system agreed upon by scientists and mathematicians.

Some physical quantities are more fundamental than others. In physics, there are seven fundamental physical quantities that are measured in base or physical fundamental units: length, mass, time, electric current temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. Units for other physical quantities (such as force, speed, and electric charge) described by mathematically combining these seven base units. In this course, we will mainly use five of these: length, mass, time, electric current and temperature. The units in which they are measured are the meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela (Table 1.1). All other units are made by mathematically combining the fundamental units. These are called derived units.These are called derived units.

The SI unit for length is the meter $()$. The definition of the meter has changed over time to become more accurate and precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar. (The bar is now housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Meaures, near Paris). By 1960, some distances could be measured more precisely by comparing them to wavelengths of light. The meter was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/ $299,792,458$ of a second (Figure 1.14).In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/ $299,792,458$ of a second (Figure 1.14).

The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg). It is defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder, housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the standard kilogram cylinder are kept in numerous locations throughout the world, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The determination of all other masses can be done by comparing them with one of these standard kilograms.The determination of all other masses can be done by comparing them with one of these standard kilograms.


The SI unit for time, the second (s) also has a long history. For many years it was defined as $1 / 86,400$ of an average solar day. However, the average solar day is actually very gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth's rotation. Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, since all other measurements are derived from them. Therefore, a new standard was adopted to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant phenomenon is the very steady vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the cesium atomic clock. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations (Figure 1.15).In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations (Figure 1.15).

Electric current is measured in the ampere (A), named after Andre Ampere. You have probably heard of amperes, or amps, when people discuss electrical currents or electrical devices. Understanding an ampere requires a basic understanding of electricity and magnetism, something that will be explored in depth in later chapters of this book. Basically, two parallel wires with an electric current running through them will produce an attractive force on each other. One ampere is defined as the amount of electric current that will produce an attractive force of $2.7  10^{-7}$ newton per meter of separation between the two wires (the newton is the derived unit of force).ere is defined as the amount of electric current that will produce an attractive force of $2.7  10^{-7}$ newton per meter of separation between the two wires (the newton is the derived unit of force).


The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (or kelvins, but not degrees kelvin). This scale is named after physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who was the first to call for an absolute temperature scale. The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero. This is the point at which all thermal energy has been removed from all atoms or molecules in a system. This temperature, o $$, is equal to $-273.15^{ $ and $-459.67^{ $. Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as the Celsius scale. For example, the freezing point $  and boiling points of water $  are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale. These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point $=273.15 $; boiling point $=373.15 $ ).These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point $=273.15 $; boiling point $=373.15 $ ).

Metric PrefixesMetric Prefixes

Physical objects or phenomena may vary widely. For example, the size of objects varies from something very small (like an atom)
to something very large (like a star). Yet the standard metric unit of length is the meter. So, the metric system includes many prefixes that can be attached to a unit. Each prefix is based on factors of $10(10,100,1,000$, etc., as well as $0.1,0.01,0.001$, etc.). Table 1.2 gives the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote the different various factors of 10 in the metric system.Table 1.2 gives the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote the different various factors of 10 in the metric system.

The metric system is convenient because conversions between metric units can be done simply by moving the decimal place of a number. This is because the metric prefixes are sequential powers of 10 . There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as U.S. customary units, the relationships are less simple-there are 12 inches in a foot, 5,280 feet in a mile, 4 quarts in a gallon, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by switching to the most-appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable for building construction, but kilometers are used to describe road construction. Therefore, with the metric system, there is no need to invent new units when measuring very small or very large objects-you just have to move the decimal
point (and use the appropriate prefix).Therefore, with the metric system, there is no need to invent new units when measuring very small or very large objects-you just have to move the decimal

Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal. For example, consider the number $840,000,000,000,000$. It's a rather large number to write out. The scientific notation for this number is $8.40  10^{14}$. Scientific notation follows this general formatScientific notation follows this general format


x  10^{y}

x  10^{y}


In this format $x$ is the value of the measurement with all placeholder zeros removed. In the example above, $x$ is 8.4. The $x$ is multiplied by a factor, $10^{y}$, which indicates the number of placeholder zeros in the measurement. Placeholder zeros are those at the end of a number that is 10 or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1 . In the example above, the factor is $10^{14}$. This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in placeholder zeros as you go. In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that the actual measurement value is $840,000,000,000,000$.In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that the actual measurement value is $840,000,000,000,000$.

Numbers that are fractions can be indicated by scientific notation as well. Consider the number 0.0000045 . Its scientific notation is $4.5  10^{-6}$. Its scientific notation has the same formatIts scientific notation has the same format

$x  10^{y}$.$x  10^{y}$.

Here, $x$ is 4.5. However, the value of $y$ in the $10^{y}$ factor is negative, which indicates that the measurement is a fraction of 1 . Therefore, we move the decimal place to the left, for a negative $y$. In our example of $4.5  10^{-6}$, the decimal point would be moved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045 .In our example of $4.5  10^{-6}$, the decimal point would be moved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045 .

The term order of magnitude refers to the power of 10 when numbers are expressed in scientific notation. Quantities that have the same power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it, are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number 800 can be written as $8  10^{2}$, and the number $450 $ be written as $4.5  10^{2}$. Both numbers have the same value for $y$. Therefore, 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99 would be regarded as the same order of magnitude, $10^{2}$. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter of an atom is on the order of $10^{-9} $, while the diameter of the sun is on the order of $10^{9} $. These two values are 18 orders of magnitude apart.These two values are 18 orders of magnitude apart.

It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook in the United States, some quantities may be expressed in liters and you need to convert them to cups. A Canadian tourist driving through the United States might want to convert miles to kilometers, to have a sense of how far away his next destination is. A doctor in the United States might convert a patient's weight in pounds to kilograms.A doctor in the United States might convert a patient's weight in pounds to kilograms.

Let's consider a simple example of how to convert units within the metric system. How can we want to convert 1 hour to seconds?How can we want to convert 1 hour to seconds?

Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. A conversion factor is simply a fraction which equals 1 . You can multiply any number by 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply multiplying it by one. For example, the following are conversion factors: $(1$ foot $) /(12$ inches $)=1$ to convert inches to feet, $(1$ meter $) /(100$ centimeters $)=1$ to convert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) $=1$ to convert seconds to minutes. In this case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.In this case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.

Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor (1 $ / 1,000 )=1$, so we are simply multiplying $80 $ by 1 :We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor (1 $ / 1,000 )=1$, so we are simply multiplying $80 $ by 1 :


1  K  }{1  h}  }{1  }=3600 =3.6  10^{2} 

1  K  }{1  h}  }{1  }=3600 =3.6  10^{2} 


When there is a unit in the original number, and a unit in the denominator (bottom) of the conversion factor, the units cancel. In this case, hours and minutes cancel and the value in seconds remains.In this case, hours and minutes cancel and the value in seconds remains.

You can use this method to convert between any types of unit, including between the U.S. customary system and metric system. Notice also that, although you can multiply and divide units algebraically, you cannot add or subtract different units. An expression like $10 +5 $ makes no sense. Even adding two lengths in different units, such as $10 +20 $ does not make sense. You express both lengths in the same unit. See Appendix C for a more complete list of conversion factors.See Appendix C for a more complete list of conversion factors.



Suppose that you drive the $10.0 $ from your university to home in $20.0 $. Calculate your average speed (a) in kilometers per hour $( / )$ and $()$ in meters per second $( / )$. (Note-Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)(Note-Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)


First we calculate the average speed using the given units. Then we can get the average speed into the desired units by picking the correct conversion factor and multiplying by it. The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels the unwanted unit and leaves the desired unit in its place.The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels the unwanted unit and leaves the desired unit in its place.

   Check the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant figures, the answer should also have three significant figures. The answer $30.0  / $ does indeed have three significant figures, so this is appropriate.

A commemorative coin that is 2 " in diameter is advertised to be plated with $15 $ of gold. If the density of gold is $19.3  / $, and the amount of gold around the edge of the coin can be ignored, what is the thickness of the gold on the top and bottom faces of the coin?If the density of gold is $19.3  / $, and the amount of gold around the edge of the coin can be ignored, what is the thickness of the gold on the top and bottom faces of the coin?


To solve this problem, the volume of the gold needs to be determined using the gold's mass and density. Half of that volume is distributed on each face of the coin, and, for each face, the gold can be represented as a cylinder that is 2 " in diameter with a height equal to the thickness. Use the volume formula for a cylinder to determine the thickness.Use the volume formula for a cylinder to determine the thickness.


The mass of the gold is given by the formula $m= V=15  10^{-3} $, where $  / $ and $V$ is the volume. Solving for the volume gives $V=  / }  7.8  10^{-4} $.Solving for the volume gives $V=  / }  7.8  10^{-4} $.

If $t$ is the thickness, the volume corresponding to half the gold is $  10^{-4} r^{2} t= $, where the $}$ has been converted to $$. Solving for the thickness gives $t=}  1.9  10^{-5} =0.00019 $.Solving for the thickness gives $t=}  1.9  10^{-5} =0.00019 $.


The amount of gold used is stated to be $15 $, which is equivalent to a thickness of about $0.00019 $. The mass figure may make the amount of gold sound larger, both because the number is much bigger (15 versus 0.00019 ), and because people may have a more intuitive feel for how much a millimeter is than for how much a milligram is. A simple analysis of this sort can clarify the significance of claims made by advertisers.A simple analysis of this sort can clarify the significance of claims made by advertisers.


Science is based on experimentation that requires good measurements. The validity of a measurement can be described in terms of its accuracy and its precision (see Figure 1.19 and Figure 1.20). Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard piece of printer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11 inches long, and suppose this stated value is correct. You measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 inches, 11.2 inches, and 10.9 inches. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. This is why measuring instruments are calibrated based on a known measurement. If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding unknown values.If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding unknown values.

Figure 1.19 A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The known masses are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 gram, 10 grams, and 100 grams.

Precision states how well repeated measurements of something generate the same or similar results. Therefore, the precision of measurements refers to how close together the measurements are when you measure the same thing several times. One way to analyze the precision of measurements would be to determine the range, or difference between the lowest and the highest measured values. In the case of the printer paper measurements, the lowest value was 10.9 inches and the highest value was 11.2 inches. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 inches. These measurements were reasonably precise because they varied by only a fraction of an inch. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and 11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to another.However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and 11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to another.

The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull's-eye target. Then think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull's eye.Then think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull's eye.

In Figure 1.21, you can see that the GPS measurements are spread far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in Figure 1.22, the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Finally, in Figure 1.23, the GPS is both precise and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located.Finally, in Figure 1.23, the GPS is both precise and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located.

The accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the uncertainty of its measurements. Uncertainty is a way to describe how much your measured value deviates from the actual value that the object has. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 inches plus or minus 0.2 inches or $11.0  0.2$ inches. The uncertainty in a
measurement, $A$, is often denoted as $ A$ ("delta $A^{  ),The uncertainty in a
measurement, $A$, is often denoted as $ A$ ("delta $A^{  ),

If you do not do this, you will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value.If you do not do this, you will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value.


There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the both the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements in the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of $4.00 $ and a width of $3.00 $, with uncertainties of 2 percent and 1
percent, respectively, then the area of the floor is $12.0 $ and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36 $$, which we round to $0.4 $ since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).the area of the floor is $12.0 $ and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36 $$, which we round to $0.4 $ since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).

For a quick demonstration of the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty of measurements based upon the units of measurement, try this simulation (). You will have the opportunity to measure the length and weight of a desk, using milli- versus centi- units. Which do you think will provide greater accuracy, precision and uncertainty when measuring the desk and the notepad in the simulation? Consider how the nature of the hypothesis or research question might influence how precise of a measuring tool you need to collect data.inty when measuring the desk and the notepad in the simulation? Consider how the nature of the hypothesis or research question might influence how precise of a measuring tool you need to collect data.


An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, consider measuring the thickness of a coin. A standard ruler can measure thickness to the nearest millimeter, while a micrometer can measure the thickness to the nearest 0.005 millimeter. The micrometer is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in thickness. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.

When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool (such as the rulers shown in Figure 1.24). For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it with a decimeter ruler as $3.6 $. You could not express this value as $3.65 $ because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between $36 $ and $37 $. He or she must estimate the value of the last digit. The rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. For example, the last measured value $36.5 $ has three digits, or three significant figures. The number of significant figures in a measurement indicates the precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can report.The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can report.

Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. For example, the zeros in 0.053 are not significant because they are only placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053 -the 5 and the 3 . However, if the zero occurs between other significant figures, the zeros are significant. For example, both zeros in 10.053 are significant, as these zeros were actually measured. Therefore, the 10.053 placeholder has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last zero, or the zeros could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity,
write 1300 in scientific notation as $1.3  10^{3}$. Only significant figures are given in the $x$ factor for a number in scientific notation (in the form $x  10^{y}$ ). Therefore, we know that 1 and 3 are the only significant digits in this number. In summary, zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders. Table 1.4 provides examples of the number of significant figures in various numbers.Table 1.4 provides examples of the number of significant figures in various numbers.

When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and another rule for addition and subtraction, as discussed below.There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and another rule for addition and subtraction, as discussed below.


   For multiplication and division: The answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value with the fewest significant figures. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using $A= r^{2}$. Let us see how many significant figures the area will have if the radius has only two significant figures, for example, $r=2.0 $. Then, using a calculator that keeps eight significant figures, you would get

A= r^{2}=(3.1415927   =4.5238934 


But because the radius has only two significant figures, the area calculated is meaningful only to two significant figures orBut because the radius has only two significant figures, the area calculated is meaningful only to two significant figures or


A=4.5 

A=4.5 


even though the value of $ is meaningful to at least eight digits.even though the value of $ is meaningful to at least eight digits.


  
   For addition and subtraction: The answer should have the same number places (e.g. tens place, ones place, tenths place, etc.) as the least-precise starting value. Suppose that you buy $7.56 $ of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale having a precision of $0.01 $. Then you drop off $6.052 $ of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with a precision of $0.001 $. Finally, you go home and add $13.7 $ of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with a precision of $0.1 $. How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:

$7.56 $ 
$-6.052 $ 
$+13.7 $ 

$15.208 $ 




The least precise measurement is $13.7 $. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer should be rounded to the tenths place, giving $15.2 $. The same is true for non-decimal numbers. For example,For example,


6527.23+2=6528.23=6528

6527.23+2=6528.23=6528


We cannot report the decimal places in the answer because 2 has no decimal places that would be significant. Therefore, we can only report to the ones place.Therefore, we can only report to the ones place.

It is a good idea to keep extra significant figures while calculating, and to round off to the correct number of significant figures only in the final answers. The reason is that small errors from rounding while calculating can sometimes produce significant errors in the final answer. As an example, try calculating 5,098 $-(5.000)  to obtain a final answer to only two significant figures. Keeping all significant during the calculation gives 48 . Rounding to two significant figures in the middle of the calculation changes it to $5,100-(5.000)  which is way off. You would similarly avoid rounding in the middle of the calculation in counting and in doing accounting, where many small numbers need to be added and subtracted accurately to give possibly much larger final numbers.rly avoid rounding in the middle of the calculation in counting and in doing accounting, where many small numbers need to be added and subtracted accurately to give possibly much larger final numbers.


In this textbook, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, such as optics, more than three significant figures will be used. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the 2 in the formula, $c=2  r$, it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.Finally, if a number is exact, such as the 2 in the formula, $c=2  r$, it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.



The U.S. federal deficit in the 2008 fiscal year was a little greater than $ 10$ trillion. Most of us do not have any concept of how much even one trillion actually is. Suppose that you were given a trillion dollars in $ 100$ bills. If you made 100-bill stacks, like that shown in Figure 1.25, and used them to evenly cover a football field (between the end zones), make an approximation of how high the money pile would become. (We will use feet/inches rather than meters here because football fields are measured in yards.) One of your friends says 3 in., while another says $10 $. What do you think?What do you think?

When you imagine the situation, you probably envision thousands of small stacks of 100 wrapped $ 100$ bills, such as you might see in movies or at a bank. Since this is an easy-to-approximate quantity, let us start there. We can find the volume of a stack of 100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion dollars, and then set this volume equal to the area of the football field multiplied by the unknown height.e can find the volume of a stack of 100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion dollars, and then set this volume equal to the area of the football field multiplied by the unknown height.

Most results in science are presented in scientific journal articles using graphs. Graphs present data in a way that is easy to visualize for humans in general, especially someone unfamiliar with what is being studied. They are also useful for presenting large amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way.They are also useful for presenting large amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way.

One commonly-used graph in physics and other sciences is the line graph, probably because it is the best graph for showing how one quantity changes in response to the other. Let's build a line graph based on the data in Table 1.5, which shows the measured distance that a train travels from its station versus time. Our two variables, or things that change along the graph, are time in minutes, and distance from the station, in kilometers. Remember that measured data may not have perfect accuracy.Remember that measured data may not have perfect accuracy.

   Draw the two axes. The horizontal axis, or $x$-axis, shows the independent variable, which is the variable that is controlled or manipulated. The vertical axis, or $y$-axis, shows the dependent variable, the non-manipulated variable that changes with (or is dependent on) the value of the independent variable. In the data above, time is the independent variable and should be plotted on the $x$-axis. Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be plotted on the $y$-axis.Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be plotted on the $y$-axis.

   Label each axes on the graph with the name of each variable, followed by the symbol for its units in parentheses. Be sure to leave room so that you can number each axis. In this example, use Time (min) as the label for the $x$-axis.In this example, use Time (min) as the label for the $x$-axis.

   Next, you must determine the best scale to use for numbering each axis. Because the time values on the $x$-axis are taken every 10 minutes, we could easily number the $x$-axis from $ to 70 minutes with a tick mark every 10 minutes. Likewise, the $y$-axis scale should start low enough and continue high enough to include all of the distance from station values. A scale from $$ to $160 $ should suffice, perhaps with a tick mark every $10 $.A scale from $$ to $160 $ should suffice, perhaps with a tick mark every $10 $.



In general, you want to pick a scale for both axes that 1) shows all of your data, and 2) makes it easy to identify trends in your data. If you make your scale too large, it will be harder to see how your data change. Likewise, the smaller and more fine you make your scale, the more space you will need to make the graph. The number of significant figures in the axis values should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements.The number of significant figures in the axis values should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements.


  
   Now that your axes are ready, you can begin plotting your data. For the first data point, count along the $x$-axis until you find the 10 min tick mark. Then, count up from that point to the $10 $ tick mark on the $y$-axis, and approximate where $22 $ is along the $y$-axis. Place a dot at this location. Repeat for the other six data points (Figure 1.26).

   Finally, with data points now on the graph, you should draw a trend line (Figure 1.27). The trend line represents the dependence you think the graph represents, so that the person who looks at your graph can see how close it is to the real data. In the present case, since the data points look like they ought to fall on a straight line, you would draw a straight line as the trend line. Draw it to come closest to all the points. Real data may have some inaccuracies, and the plotted points may not all fall on the trend line. In some cases, none of the data points fall exactly on the trend line.In some cases, none of the data points fall exactly on the trend line.

One way to get a quick snapshot of a dataset is to look at the equation of its trend line. If the graph produces a straight line, the equation of the trend line takes the formIf the graph produces a straight line, the equation of the trend line takes the form


y=m x+b

y=m x+b


The $b$ in the equation is the $y$-intercept while the $m$ in the equation is the slope. The $y$-intercept tells you at what $y$ value the line intersects the $y$-axis. In the case of the graph above, the $y$-intercept occurs at 0 , at the very beginning of the graph. The $y$-intercept, therefore, lets you know immediately where on the $y$-axis the plot line begins.The $y$-intercept, therefore, lets you know immediately where on the $y$-axis the plot line begins.

The $m$ in the equation is the slope. This value describes how much the line on the graph moves up or down on the $y$-axis along the line's length. The slope is found using the following equationThe slope is found using the following equation


m=}

m=}


In order to solve this equation, you need to pick two points on the line (preferably far apart on the line so the slope you calculate describes the line accurately). The quantities $Y_{2}$ and $Y_{1}$ represent the $y$-values from the two points on the line (not data points) that you picked, while $X_{2}$ and $X_{1}$ represent the two $x$-values of the those points.e quantities $Y_{2}$ and $Y_{1}$ represent the $y$-values from the two points on the line (not data points) that you picked, while $X_{2}$ and $X_{1}$ represent the two $x$-values of the those points.

What can the slope value tell you about the graph? The slope of a perfectly horizontal line will equal zero, while the slope of a perfectly vertical line will be undefined because you cannot divide by zero. A positive slope indicates that the line moves up the $y$-axis as the $x$-value increases while a negative slope means that the line moves down the $y$-axis. The more negative or positive the slope is, the steeper the line moves up or down, respectively.

The formula $y=m x+b$ only applies to linear relationships, or ones that produce a straight line. Another common type of line in physics is the quadratic relationship, which occurs when one of the variables is squared. One quadratic relationship in physics is the relation between the speed of an object its centripetal acceleration, which is used to determine the force needed to keep an object moving in a circle. Another common relationship in physics is the inverse relationship, in which one variable decreases whenever the other variable increases. An example in physics is Coulomb's law. As the distance between two charged objects increases, the electrical force between the two charged objects decreases.

for some number $k$, is one particular kind of inverse relationship. A third commonly-seen relationship is the exponential relationship, in which a change in the independent variable produces a proportional change in the dependent variable. As the value of the dependent variable gets larger, its rate of growth also increases. For example, bacteria often reproduce at an exponential rate when grown under ideal conditions. As each generation passes, there are more and more bacteria to reproduce. As a result, the growth rate of the bacterial population increases every generation (Figure 1.28).As a result, the growth rate of the bacterial population increases every generation (Figure 1.28).

Sometimes a variable can have a very large range of values. This presents a problem when you're trying to figure out the best scale to use for your graph's axes. One option is to use a logarithmic (log) scale. In a logarithmic scale, the value each mark labels
is the previous mark's value multiplied by some constant. For a log base 10 scale, each mark labels a value that is 10 times the value of the mark before it. Therefore, a base 10 logarithmic scale would be numbered: $0,10,100,1,000$, etc. You can see how the logarithmic scale covers a much larger range of values than the corresponding linear scale, in which the marks would label the values $0,10,20,30$, and so on.You can see how the logarithmic scale covers a much larger range of values than the corresponding linear scale, in which the marks would label the values $0,10,20,30$, and so on.

If you use a logarithmic scale on one axis of the graph and a linear scale on the other axis, you are using a semi-log plot. The Richter scale, which measures the strength of earthquakes, uses a semi-log plot. The degree of ground movement is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the assigned intensity level of the earthquake, which ranges linearly from 1-10 (Figure 1.29 (a)).The degree of ground movement is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the assigned intensity level of the earthquake, which ranges linearly from 1-10 (Figure 1.29 (a)).

If a graph has both axes in a logarithmic scale, then it is referred to as a $ - plot. The relationship between the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation such as light is usually shown as a log-log plot (Figure 1.29 (b)). Log-log plots are also commonly used to describe exponential functions, such as radioactive decay.Log-log plots are also commonly used to describe exponential functions, such as radioactive decay.

   The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature.
   Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units.

INTRODUCTION Unless you have flown in an airplane, you have probably never traveled faster than $150 $. Can you imagine traveling in a train like the one shown in Figure 2.1 that goes over $300 $ ? Despite the high speed, the people riding in this train may not notice that they are moving at all unless they look out the window! This is because motion, even motion at 300 $$, is relative to the observer. the high speed, the people riding in this train may not notice that they are moving at all unless they look out the window! This is because motion, even motion at 300 $$, is relative to the observer.

In this chapter, you will learn why it is important to identify a reference frame in order to clearly describe motion. For now, the motion you describe will be one-dimensional. Within this context, you will learn the difference between distance and displacement as well as the difference between speed and velocity. Then you will look at some graphing and problem-solving techniques.Then you will look at some graphing and problem-solving techniques.

Our study of physics opens with kinematics-the study of motion without considering its causes. Objects are in motion everywhere you look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving.Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving.

How do you know something is moving? The location of an object at any particular time is its position. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professor's position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. (See Figure 2.2.) Thus, you can only know how fast and in what direction an object's position is changing against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving with a known speed and direction. The reference frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described.The reference frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described.

Your classroom can be used as a reference frame. In the classroom, the walls are not moving. Your motion as you walk to the door, can be measured against the stationary background of the classroom walls. You can also tell if other things in the classroom are moving, such as your classmates entering the classroom or a book falling off a desk. You can also tell in what direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say, "The teacher is moving toward the door." Your reference frame allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion.You might say, "The teacher is moving toward the door." Your reference frame allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion.

You could also serve as a reference frame for others' movement. If you remained seated as your classmates left the room, you would measure their movement away from your stationary location. If you and your classmates left the room together, then your perspective of their motion would be change. You, as the reference frame, would be moving in the same direction as your other moving classmates. As you will learn in the Snap Lab, your description of motion can be quite different when viewed from different reference frames.As you will learn in the Snap Lab, your description of motion can be quite different when viewed from different reference frames.

Figure 2.3 Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) studied motion and developed the concept of a reference frame. (Domenico Tintoretto)(Domenico Tintoretto)

The idea that a description of motion depends on the reference frame of the observer has been known for hundreds of years. The $17^{ {th }}$-century astronomer Galileo Galilei (Figure 2.3) was one of the first scientists to explore this idea. Galileo suggested the following thought experiment: Imagine a windowless ship moving at a constant speed and direction along a perfectly calm sea. Is there a way that a person inside the ship can determine whether the ship is moving? You can extend this thought experiment
by also imagining a person standing on the shore. How can a person on the shore determine whether the ship is moving?How can a person on the shore determine whether the ship is moving?

Galileo came to an amazing conclusion. Only by looking at each other can a person in the ship or a person on shore describe the motion of one relative to the other. In addition, their descriptions of motion would be identical. A person inside the ship would describe the person on the land as moving past the ship. The person on shore would describe the ship and the person inside it as moving past. Galileo realized that observers moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other describe motion in the same way. Galileo had discovered that a description of motion is only meaningful if you specify a reference frame.Galileo had discovered that a description of motion is only meaningful if you specify a reference frame.

As we study the motion of objects, we must first be able to describe the object's position. Before your parent drives you to school, the car is sitting in your driveway. Your driveway is the starting position for the car. When you reach your high school, the car has changed position. Its new position is your school.Its new position is your school.

Figure 2.4 Your total change in position is measured from your house to your school.Figure 2.4 Your total change in position is measured from your house to your school.

Physicists use variables to represent terms. We will use $$ to represent car's position. We will use a subscript to differentiate between the initial position, $$, and the final position, $}$. In addition, vectors, which we will discuss later, will be in bold or will have an arrow above the variable. Scalars will be italicized.Scalars will be italicized.


In some books, $$ or $$ is used instead of $$ to describe position. In $$, said $d$ naught, the subscript o stands for initial. When we begin to talk about two-dimensional motion, sometimes other subscripts will be used to describe horizontal position, $}$, or vertical position, $}$. So, you might see references to $}$ and $}$.So, you might see references to $}$ and $}$.

Now imagine driving from your house to a friend's house located several kilometers away. How far would you drive? The distance an object moves is the length of the path between its initial position and its final position. The distance you drive to your friend's house depends on your path. As shown in Figure 2.5, distance is different from the length of a straight line between two points. The distance you drive to your friend's house is probably longer than the straight line between the two houses.The distance you drive to your friend's house is probably longer than the straight line between the two houses.

We often want to be more precise when we talk about position. The description of an object's motion often includes more than just the distance it moves. For instance, if it is a five kilometer drive to school, the distance traveled is 5 kilometers. After dropping you off at school and driving back home, your parent will have traveled a total distance of 10 kilometers. The car and your parent will end up in the same starting position in space. The net change in position of an object is its displacement, or $ d. The Greek letter delta, $ means change in.The Greek letter delta, $ means change in.

If you are describing only your drive to school, then the distance traveled and the displacement are the same -5 kilometers.

If we ascribe the forward direction a positive (+) and the opposite direction a negative (-), then the two quantities will cancel each other out when added together.If we ascribe the forward direction a positive (+) and the opposite direction a negative (-), then the two quantities will cancel each other out when added together.

Hopefully you now understand the conceptual difference between distance and displacement. Understanding concepts is half the battle in physics. The other half is math. A stumbling block to new physics students is trying to wade through the math of physics while also trying to understand the associated concepts. This struggle may lead to misconceptions and answers that make no sense. Once the concept is mastered, the math is far less confusing.Once the concept is mastered, the math is far less confusing.

So let's review and see if we can make sense of displacement in terms of numbers and equations. You can calculate an object's displacement by subtracting its original position, $}$, from its final position $}$. In math terms that meansIn math terms that means


 

 


If the final position is the same as the initial position, then $ =0$.If the final position is the same as the initial position, then $ =0$.

To assign numbers and/or direction to these quantities, we need to define an axis with a positive and a negative direction. We also need to define an origin, or $O$. In Figure 2.6, the axis is in a straight line with home at zero and school in the positive direction. If we left home and drove the opposite way from school, motion would have been in the negative direction. We would have assigned it a negative value. In the round-trip drive, $}$ and $}$ were both at zero kilometers. In the one way trip to school, $}$ was at 5 kilometers and $$ was at zero $$. So, $ $ was 5 kilometers.So, $ $ was 5 kilometers.


You may place your origin wherever you would like. You have to make sure that you calculate all distances consistently from your zero and you define one direction as positive and the other as negative. Therefore, it makes sense to choose the easiest axis, direction, and zero. In the example above, we took home to be zero because it allowed us to avoid having to interpret a solution with a negative sign.In the example above, we took home to be zero because it allowed us to avoid having to interpret a solution with a negative sign.

To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the final position and the initial position while taking care to note the direction on the axis. The final position is the sum of the two displacements, $ $ and $ $.The final position is the sum of the two displacements, $ $ and $ $.

Physicists like to use standard units so it is easier to compare notes. The standard units for calculations are called SI units (International System of Units). SI units are based on the metric system. The SI unit for displacement is the meter (m), but sometimes you will see a problem with kilometers, miles, feet, or other units of length. If one unit in a problem is an SI unit and another is not, you will need to convert all of your quantities to the same system before you can carry out the calculation.If one unit in a problem is an SI unit and another is not, you will need to convert all of your quantities to the same system before you can carry out the calculation.

Figure 2.7 The Mars Climate Orbiter disaster illustrates the importance of using the correct calculations in physics. (NASA)(NASA)

Physicists make calculations all the time, but they do not always get the right answers. In 1998, NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, launched the Mars Climate Orbiter, shown in Figure 2.7, a  satellite designed to monitor the Martian atmosphere. It was supposed to orbit the planet and take readings from a safe distance. The American scientists made calculations in English units (feet, inches, pounds, etc.) and forgot to convert their answers to the standard metric SI units. This was a very costly mistake. Instead of orbiting the planet as planned, the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up flying into the Martian atmosphere. The probe disintegrated. It was one of the biggest embarrassments in NASA's history.It was one of the biggest embarrassments in NASA's history.


In 1999 the Mars Climate Orbiter crashed because calculation were performed in English units instead of SI units. At one point the orbiter was just 187,000 feet above the surface, which was too close to stay in orbit. What was the height of the orbiter at this time in kilometers?

There is more to motion than distance and displacement. Questions such as, "How long does a foot race take?" and "What was the runner's speed?" cannot be answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section we will look at time, speed, and velocity to expand our understanding of motion.In this section we will look at time, speed, and velocity to expand our understanding of motion.

A description of how fast or slow an object moves is its speed. Speed is the rate at which an object changes its location. Like distance, speed is a scalar because it has a magnitude but not a direction. Because speed is a rate, it depends on the time interval of motion. You can calculate the elapsed time or the change in time, $ t$, of motion as the difference between the ending time and the beginning timeYou can calculate the elapsed time or the change in time, $ t$, of motion as the difference between the ending time and the beginning time

When you describe an object's speed, you often describe the average over a time period. Average speed, $v_{ {avg }}$, is the distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs.Average speed, $v_{ {avg }}$, is the distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs.

VelocityVelocity

The vector version of speed is velocity. Velocity describes the speed and direction of an object. As with speed, it is useful to describe either the average velocity over a time period or the velocity at a specific moment. Average velocity is displacement divided by the time over which the displacement occurs.Average velocity is displacement divided by the time over which the displacement occurs.

}{ { time }}=}{ t}=}


Velocity, like speed, has SI units of meters per second $( / )$, but because it is a vector, you must also include a direction. Furthermore, the variable $$ for velocity is bold because it is a vector, which is in contrast to the variable $v$ for speed which is italicized because it is a scalar quantity.Furthermore, the variable $$ for velocity is bold because it is a vector, which is in contrast to the variable $v$ for speed which is italicized because it is a scalar quantity.


It is important to keep in mind that the average speed is not the same thing as the average velocity without its direction. Like we saw with displacement and distance in the last section, changes in direction over a time interval have a bigger effect on speed and velocity.Like we saw with displacement and distance in the last section, changes in direction over a time interval have a bigger effect on speed and velocity.

Suppose a passenger moved toward the back of a plane with an average velocity of $-4  / $. We cannot tell from the average velocity whether the passenger stopped momentarily or backed up before he got to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller segments of the trip over smaller time intervals such as those shown in Figure 2.9. If you consider infinitesimally small intervals, you can define instantaneous velocity, which is the velocity at a specific instant in time. Instantaneous velocity and average velocity are the same if the velocity is constant.Instantaneous velocity and average velocity are the same if the velocity is constant.

Earlier, you have read that distance traveled can be different than the magnitude of displacement. In the same way, speed can be different than the magnitude of velocity. For example, you drive to a store and return home in half an hour. If your car's odometer shows the total distance traveled was $6 $, then your average speed was $12  / $. Your average velocity, however, was zero because your displacement for the round trip is zero.Your average velocity, however, was zero because your displacement for the round trip is zero.

A graph, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only contain numerical information, they also reveal relationships between physical quantities. In this section, we will investigate kinematics by analyzing graphs of position over time.In this section, we will investigate kinematics by analyzing graphs of position over time.

Graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are plotted against each other, the horizontal axis is usually considered the independent variable, and the vertical axis is the dependent variable. In algebra, you would have referred to the horizontal axis as the $x$-axis and the vertical axis as the $y$-axis. As in Figure 2.10, a straight-line graph has the general form $y=m x+b$.As in Figure 2.10, a straight-line graph has the general form $y=m x+b$.

Here $m$ is the slope, defined as the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line. The letter $b$ is the $y$-intercept which is the point at which the line crosses the vertical, $y$-axis. In terms of a physical situation in the real world, these quantities will take on a specific significance, as we will see below. (Figure 2.10.)(Figure 2.10.)

In physics, time is usually the independent variable. Other quantities, such as displacement, are said to depend upon it. A graph of position versus time, therefore, would have position on the vertical axis (dependent variable) and time on the horizontal axis (independent variable). In this case, to what would the slope and $y$-intercept refer?

The drive to school was $5 $ from home. Let's assume it took 10 minutes to make the drive and that your parent was driving at a constant velocity the whole time.

As we said before, $=0$ because we call home our $O$ and start calculating from there. In Figure 2.11, the line starts at $=0$, as well. This is the $b$ in our equation for a straight line. Our initial position in a position versus time graph is always the place where the graph crosses the $x$-axis at $t=0$. What is the slope? The rise is the change in position, (i.e., displacement) and the run is the change in time. This relationship can also be writtenThis relationship can also be written

Sometimes, as is the case where we graph both the trip to school and the return trip, the behavior of the graph looks different during different time intervals. If the graph looks like a series of straight lines, then you can calculate the average velocity for each time interval by looking at the slope. If you then want to calculate the average velocity for the entire trip, you can do aIf you then want to calculate the average velocity for the entire trip, you can do a

But what if the graph of the position is more complicated than a straight line? What if the object speeds up or turns around and goes backward? Can we figure out anything about its velocity from a graph of that kind of motion? Let's take another look at the jet-powered car. The graph in Figure 2.13 shows its motion as it is getting up to speed after starting at rest.

The graph of position versus time in Figure 2.13 is a curve rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in Figure 2.13.

We assumed for our original calculation that your parent drove with a constant velocity to and from school. We now know that the car could not have gone from rest to a constant velocity without speeding up. So the actual graph would be curved on either end, but let's make the same approximation as we did then, anyway.So the actual graph would be curved on either end, but let's make the same approximation as we did then, anyway.


It is common in physics, especially at the early learning stages, for certain things to be neglected, as we see here. This is because it makes the concept clearer or the calculation easier. Practicing physicists use these kinds of short-cuts, as well. It works out because usually the thing being neglected is small enough that it does not significantly affect the answer. In the earlier example, the amount of time it takes the car to speed up and reach its cruising velocity is very small compared to the total time traveled.In the earlier example, the amount of time it takes the car to speed up and reach its cruising velocity is very small compared to the total time traveled.

Looking at this graph, and given what we learned, we can see that there are two distinct periods to the car's motion-the way to school and the way back. The average velocity for the drive to school is $0.5  / $. We can see that the average velocity for the drive back is $-0.5  /$ minute. If we plot the data showing velocity versus time, we get another graph (Figure 2.16):If we plot the data showing velocity versus time, we get another graph (Figure 2.16):

We can learn a few things. First, we can derive a v versus $t$ graph from a d versus $t$ graph. Second, if we have a straight-line position-time graph that is positively or negatively sloped, it will yield a horizontal velocity graph. There are a few other interesting things to note. Just as we could use a position vs. time graph to determine velocity, we can use a velocity vs. time graph to determine position. We know that $ / t$. If we use a little algebra to re-arrange the equation, we see that $  t$. In Figure 2.16, we have velocity on the $y$-axis and time along the $x$-axis. Let's take just the first half of the motion. We get $0.5  /$ minute $ 10$ minutes. The units for minutes cancel each other, and we get $5 $, which is the displacement for the trip to school. If we calculate the same for the return trip, we get $-5 $. If we add them together, we see that the net displacement for the
whole trip is o km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place.If we add them together, we see that the net displacement for the
whole trip is o km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place.


You can treat units just like you treat numbers, so a $ / =1$ (or, we say, it cancels out). This is good because it can tell us whether or not we have calculated everything with the correct units. For instance, if we end up with $  $ for velocity instead of $ / $, we know that something has gone wrong, and we need to check our math. This process is called dimensional analysis, and it is one of the best ways to check if your math makes sense in physics.This process is called dimensional analysis, and it is one of the best ways to check if your math makes sense in physics.

The area under a velocity curve represents the displacement. The velocity curve also tells us whether the car is speeding up. In our earlier example, we stated that the velocity was constant. So, the car is not speeding up. Graphically, you can see that the slope of these two lines is 0 . This slope tells us that the car is not speeding up, or accelerating. We will do more with this information in a later chapter. For now, just remember that the area under the graph and the slope are the two important parts of the graph. Just like we could define a linear equation for the motion in a position vs. time graph, we can also define one for a velocity vs. time graph. As we said, the slope equals the acceleration, $$. And in this graph, the $y$-intercept is $}$. Thus, $ t$.Thus, $ t$.

But what if the velocity is not constant? Let's look back at our jet-car example. At the beginning of the motion, as the car is speeding up, we saw that its position is a curve, as shown in Figure 2.17.At the beginning of the motion, as the car is speeding up, we saw that its position is a curve, as shown in Figure 2.17.

INTRODUCTION You may have heard the term accelerator, referring to the gas pedal in a car. When the gas pedal is pushed down, the flow of gasoline to the engine increases, which increases the car's velocity. Pushing on the gas pedal results in acceleration because the velocity of the car increases, and acceleration is defined as a change in velocity. You need two quantities to define velocity: a speed and a direction. Changing either of these quantities, or both together, changes the velocity. You may be surprised to learn that pushing on the brake pedal or turning the steering wheel also causes acceleration. The first reduces the speed and so changes the velocity, and the second changes the direction and also changes the velocity.The first reduces the speed and so changes the velocity, and the second changes the direction and also changes the velocity.

In fact, any change in velocity-whether positive, negative, directional, or any combination of these-is called an acceleration in physics. The plane in the picture is said to be accelerating because its velocity is decreasing as it prepares to land. To begin our study of acceleration, we need to have a clear understanding of what acceleration means.To begin our study of acceleration, we need to have a clear understanding of what acceleration means.

Throughout this chapter we will use the following terms: time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Recall that each of these terms has a designated variable and SI unit of measurement as follows:Recall that each of these terms has a designated variable and SI unit of measurement as follows:

Acceleration is the change in velocity divided by a period of time during which the change occurs. The SI units of velocity are $ / $ and the SI units for time are s, so the SI units for acceleration are $ / $. Average acceleration is given byAverage acceleration is given by

Average acceleration is distinguished from instantaneous acceleration, which is acceleration at a specific instant in time. The magnitude of acceleration is often not constant over time. For example, runners in a race accelerate at a greater rate in the first second of a race than during the following seconds. You do not need to know all the instantaneous accelerations at all times to calculate average acceleration. All you need to know is the change in velocity (i.e., the final velocity minus the initial velocity) and the change in time (i.e., the final time minus the initial time), as shown in the formula. Note that the average acceleration can be positive, negative, or zero. A negative acceleration is simply an acceleration in the negative direction.A negative acceleration is simply an acceleration in the negative direction.

Keep in mind that although acceleration points in the same direction as the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of the velocity itself. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its velocity. In everyday language, this is called deceleration; but in physics, it is acceleration-whose direction happens to be opposite that of the velocity. For now, let us assume that motion to the right along the $x$-axis is positive and motion to the left is negative.For now, let us assume that motion to the right along the $x$-axis is positive and motion to the left is negative.

Velocity and acceleration are both vector quantities. Recall that vectors have both magnitude and direction. An object traveling at a constant velocity-therefore having no acceleration-does accelerate if it changes direction. So, turning the steering wheel of a moving car makes the car accelerate because the velocity changes direction.So, turning the steering wheel of a moving car makes the car accelerate because the velocity changes direction.



With this animation in, you can produce both variations of acceleration and velocity shown in Figure 3.2, plus a few more variations. Vary the velocity and acceleration by sliding the red and green markers along the scales. Keeping the velocity marker near zero will make the effect of acceleration more obvious. Try changing acceleration from positive to negative while the man is moving.

Look back at the equation for average acceleration. You can see that the calculation of average acceleration involves three values: change in time, $( t)$; change in velocity, $( v)$; and acceleration $(a)$.You can see that the calculation of average acceleration involves three values: change in time, $( t)$; change in velocity, $( v)$; and acceleration $(a)$.

Change in time is often stated as a time interval, and change in velocity can often be calculated by subtracting the initial velocity from the final velocity. Average acceleration is then simply change in velocity divided by change in time. Before you begin calculating, be sure that all distances and times have been converted to meters and seconds.

   Identify the knowns. Be sure to read the problem for given information, which may not look like numbers. When the problem states that the train starts from rest, you can write down that the initial velocity is $  / $. Therefore, $v_{}=0 ; v_{}=$ $30.0  / $; and $ t=20.0 $.Therefore, $v_{}=0 ; v_{}=$ $30.0  / $; and $ t=20.0 $.

The plus sign in the answer means that acceleration is to the right.

So, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, as it should be.So, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, as it should be.

In this case, the train is decelerating and its acceleration is negative because it is pointing to the left. As in the previous example, we must find the change in velocity and change in time, then solve for acceleration.As in the previous example, we must find the change in velocity and change in time, then solve for acceleration.

   Calculate change in velocity, $ v=v_{=0-8.333  / =-8.333  / $, where the minus sign means that the change in velocity points to the left.   Calculate change in velocity, $ v=v_{=0-8.333  / =-8.333  / $, where the minus sign means that the change in velocity points to the left.

The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This is reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this problem, and a negative acceleration would reduce the velocity. Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, which is negative in this case. This acceleration can be called a deceleration because it has a direction opposite to the velocity.This acceleration can be called a deceleration because it has a direction opposite to the velocity.



   It is easier to get plus and minus signs correct if you always assume that motion is away from zero and toward positive values on the $x$-axis. This way $v$ always starts off being positive and points to the right. If speed is increasing, then acceleration is positive and also points to the right. If speed is decreasing, then acceleration is negative and points to the left.
   It is a good idea to carry two extra significant figures from step-to-step when making calculations. Do not round off with each step. When you arrive at the final answer, apply the rules of significant figures for the operations you carried out and round to the correct number of digits. Sometimes this will make your answer slightly more accurate.

We are studying concepts related to motion: time, displacement, velocity, and especially acceleration. We are only concerned with motion in one dimension. The kinematic equations apply to conditions of constant acceleration and show how these concepts are related. Constant acceleration is acceleration that does not change over time.

This equation says that average velocity is displacement per unit time. We will express velocity in meters per second. If we graph displacement versus time, as in Figure 3.6, the slope will be the velocity. Whenever a rate, such as velocity, is represented graphically, time is usually taken to be the independent variable and is plotted along the $x$ axis.Whenever a rate, such as velocity, is represented graphically, time is usually taken to be the independent variable and is plotted along the $x$ axis.

Note that, in reality, knowns and unknowns will vary. Sometimes you will want to rearrange a kinematic equation so that the knowns are the values on the axes and the unknown is the slope. Sometimes the intercept will not be at the origin $(0,0)$. This will happen when $v_{0}$ or $d_{0}$ is not zero. This will be the case when the object of interest is already in motion, or the motion begins at some point other than at the origin of the coordinate system.This will be the case when the object of interest is already in motion, or the motion begins at some point other than at the origin of the coordinate system.

Problem-solving skills are essential to success in a science and life in general. The ability to apply broad physical principles, which are often represented by equations, to specific situations is a very powerful form of knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities can be applied to new situations, whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Essential analytical skills will be developed by solving problems in this text and will be useful for understanding physics and science in general throughout your life.Essential analytical skills will be developed by solving problems in this text and will be useful for understanding physics and science in general throughout your life.

The object of the sport of drag racing is acceleration. Period! The races take place from a standing start on a straight onequarter-mile (402 m) track. Usually two cars race side by side, and the winner is the driver who gets the car past the quarter-mile point first. At the finish line, the cars may be going more than 300 miles per hour $(134  / )$. The driver then deploys a parachute to bring the car to a stop because it is unsafe to brake at such high speeds. The cars, called dragsters, are capable of accelerating at $26  / $. By comparison, a typical sports car that is available to the general public can accelerate at about $5  / $.By comparison, a typical sports car that is available to the general public can accelerate at about $5  / $.

   The final velocity depends on the magnitude of the acceleration and the distance over which it applies.

In many cases, acceleration is not uniform because the force acting on the accelerating object is not constant over time. A situation that gives constant acceleration is the acceleration of falling objects. When air resistance is not a factor, all objects near Earth's surface fall with an acceleration of about $9.80  / $. Although this value decreases slightly with increasing altitude, it may be assumed to be essentially constant. The value of $9.80  / $ is labeled $g$ and is referred to as acceleration due to gravity. Gravity is the force that causes nonsupported objects to accelerate downward—or, more precisely, toward the center of Earth. The magnitude of this force is called the weight of the object and is given by $m g$ where $m$ is the mass of the object (in $$ ). In places other than on Earth, such as the Moon or on other planets, $g$ is not $9.80  / $, but takes on other values. When using $g$ for the acceleration $a$ in a kinematic equation, it is usually given a negative sign because the acceleration due to gravity is downward.When using $g$ for the acceleration $a$ in a kinematic equation, it is usually given a negative sign because the acceleration due to gravity is downward.

When in a vehicle that accelerates rapidly, you experience a force on your entire body that accelerates your body. You feel this force in automobiles and slightly more on amusement park rides. For example, when you ride in a car that turns, the car applies a force on your body to make you accelerate in the direction in which the car is turning. If enough force is applied, you will accelerate at $9.80  / $. This is the same as the acceleration due to gravity, so this force is called one $$.This is the same as the acceleration due to gravity, so this force is called one $$.

One $$ is the force required to accelerate an object at the acceleration due to gravity at Earth's surface. Thus, one $$ for a paper cup is much less than one $$ for an elephant, because the elephant is much more massive and requires a greater force to make it accelerate at $9.80  / $. For a person, a $$ of about 4 is so strong that his or her face will distort as the bones accelerate forward through the loose flesh. Other symptoms at extremely high Gs include changes in vision, loss of consciousness, and even death. The space shuttle produces about 3 Gs during takeoff and reentry. Some roller coasters and dragsters produce forces of around 4 Gs for their occupants. A fighter jet can produce up to $12 $ during a sharp turn.A fighter jet can produce up to $12 $ during a sharp turn.

NASA has an aircraft that allows it occupants to experience about $25 $ of free fall. The aircraft is nicknamed the Vomit Comet.The aircraft is nicknamed the Vomit Comet.

INTRODUCTION Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was a natural philosopher; a great thinker who combined science and philosophy to try to explain the workings of nature on Earth and in the universe. His laws of motion were just one part of the monumental work that has made him legendary. The development of Newton's laws marks the transition from the Renaissance period of history to the modern era. This transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people thought about the physical universe. Drawing upon earlier work by scientists Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler, Newton's laws of motion allowed motion on Earth and in space to be predicted mathematically. In this chapter you will learn about force as well as Newton's first, second, and third laws of motion.In this chapter you will learn about force as well as Newton's first, second, and third laws of motion.

Force is the cause of motion, and motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a dolphin jumping out of the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics describes only the way objects move-their velocity and their acceleration. Dynamics considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton's laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe the way objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion, and interact with other objects. They are also universal laws: they apply everywhere on Earth as well as in space.They are also universal laws: they apply everywhere on Earth as well as in space.

A force pushes or pulls an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object, a table, or an animate object, a person. The pushing or pulling may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of Earth. Forces have different magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are stronger than others and can act in different directions. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your arm.In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your arm.

When multiple forces act on an object, the forces combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on an object gives the total force, or net force. An external force is a force that acts on an object within the system from outside the system. This type of force is different than an internal force, which acts between two objects that are both within the system. The net external force combines these two definitions; it is the total combined external force. We discuss further details about net force, external force, and net external force in the coming sections.We discuss further details about net force, external force, and net external force in the coming sections.

In mathematical terms, two forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs (positive or negative). By convention, the negative sign is assigned to any movement to the left or downward. If two forces pushing in opposite directions are added together, the larger force will be somewhat canceled out by the smaller force pushing in the opposite direction. It is important to be consistent with your chosen coordinate system within a problem; for example, if negative values are assigned to the downward direction for velocity, then distance, force, and acceleration should also be designated as being negative in the downward direction.blem; for example, if negative values are assigned to the downward direction for velocity, then distance, force, and acceleration should also be designated as being negative in the downward direction.


For our first example of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This example gives us the opportunity to introduce a useful tool known as a free-body diagram. A free-body diagram represents the object being acted upon-that is, the free body-as a single point. Only the forces acting on the body (that is, external forces) are shown and are represented by vectors (which are drawn as arrows). These forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body because they cancel each other out, as explained in the section on Newton's third law of motion. Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.

Figure 4.2 An object of mass, $m$, is held up by the force of tension.Figure 4.2 An object of mass, $m$, is held up by the force of tension.

Figure 4.2 shows the force of tension in the rope acting in the upward direction, opposite the force of gravity. The forces are indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down, representing gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative magnitude (or strength) of the forces. Because forces are vectors, they add just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in Figure 4.2, which means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude. Because these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.Because these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.

Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on an object. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a magnet (in the case of magnetic force) or the gravitational pull of Earth (in the case of gravitational force).Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a magnet (in the case of magnetic force) or the gravitational pull of Earth (in the case of gravitational force).

In the next three sections discussing Newton's laws of motion, we will learn about three specific types of forces: friction, the normal force, and the gravitational force. To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.

   A body at rest tends to remain at rest.
   A body at rest tends to remain at rest.

   A body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force. (Recall that constant velocity means that the body moves in a straight line and at a constant speed.)(Recall that constant velocity means that the body moves in a straight line and at a constant speed.)



At first glance, this law may seem to contradict your everyday experience. You have probably noticed that a moving object will usually slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving. The key to understanding why, for example, a sliding box slows down (seemingly on its own) is to first understand that a net external force acts on the box to make the box slow down. Without this net external force, the box would continue to slide at a constant velocity (as stated in Newton's first law of motion). What force acts on the box to slow it down? This force is called friction. Friction is an external force that acts opposite to the direction of motion (see Figure 4.3). Think of friction as a resistance to motion that slows things down.Think of friction as a resistance to motion that slows things down.

Consider an air hockey table. When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it lifts the puck slightly, so the puck experiences very little friction as it moves over the surface. With friction almost eliminated, the puck glides along with very little change in speed. On a frictionless surface, the puck would experience no net external force (ignoring air resistance, which is also a form of friction). Additionally, if we know enough about friction, we can accurately predict how quickly objects will slow down.Additionally, if we know enough about friction, we can accurately predict how quickly objects will slow down.

Now let's think about another example. A man pushes a box across a floor at constant velocity by applying a force of $+50 $. (The positive sign indicates that, by convention, the direction of motion is to the right.) What is the force of friction that opposes the motion? The force of friction must be $-50 $. Why? According to Newton's first law of motion, any object moving at constant velocity has no net external force acting upon it, which means that the sum of the forces acting on the object must be zero. The mathematical way to say that no net external force acts on an object is $}=0$ or $ =0$. So if the man applies +50 $$ of force, then the force of friction must be $-50 $ for the two forces to add up to zero (that is, for the two forces to cancel each
other). Whenever you encounter the phrase at constant velocity, Newton's first law tells you that the net external force is zero.Whenever you encounter the phrase at constant velocity, Newton's first law tells you that the net external force is zero.

The force of friction depends on two factors: the coefficient of friction and the normal force. For any two surfaces that are in contact with one another, the coefficient of friction is a constant that depends on the nature of the surfaces. The normal force is the force exerted by a surface that pushes on an object in response to gravity pulling the object down.

Recall from the section on Force that a net external force acts from outside on the object of interest. A more precise definition is that it acts on the system of interest. A system is one or more objects that you choose to study. It is important to define the system at the beginning of a problem to figure out which forces are external and need to be considered, and which are internal and can be ignored.It is important to define the system at the beginning of a problem to figure out which forces are external and need to be considered, and which are internal and can be ignored.

For example, in Figure 4.4 (a), two children push a third child in a wagon at a constant velocity. The system of interest is the wagon plus the small child, as shown in part (b) of the figure. The two children behind the wagon exert external forces on this system (F1, F2). Friction $f$ acting at the axles of the wheels and at the surface where the wheels touch the ground two other external forces acting on the system. Two more external forces act on the system: the weight $$ of the system pulling down and the normal force $$ of the ground pushing up. Notice that the wagon is not accelerating vertically, so Newton's first law tells us that the normal force balances the weight. Because the wagon is moving forward at a constant velocity, the force of friction must have the same strength as the sum of the forces applied by the two children.

Inertia is the tendency for an object at rest to remain at rest, or for a moving object to remain in motion in a straight line with constant speed. This key property of objects was first described by Galileo. Later, Newton incorporated the concept of inertia into his first law, which is often referred to as the law of inertia.Later, Newton incorporated the concept of inertia into his first law, which is often referred to as the law of inertia.

As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. For example, changing the motion of a large truck is more difficult than changing the motion of a toy truck. In fact, the inertia of an object is proportional to the mass of the object. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter (or stuff) in an object. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined by the number and types of atoms the object contains. Unlike weight (which changes if the gravitational force changes), mass does not depend on gravity. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the moon. In practice, it is very difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object, so mass is usually not determined this way. Instead, the mass of an object is determined by comparing it with the standard kilogram. Mass is therefore expressed in kilograms.Mass is therefore expressed in kilograms.


In everyday language, people often use the terms weight and mass interchangeably this is not correct. Weight is actually a force. (We cover this topic in more detail in the section Newton's Second Law of Motion.)(We cover this topic in more detail in the section Newton's Second Law of Motion.)

Newton's first law considered bodies at rest or bodies in motion at a constant velocity. The other state of motion to consider is when an object is moving with a changing velocity, which means a change in the speed and/or the direction of motion. This type of motion is addressed by Newton's second law of motion, which states how force causes changes in motion. Newton's second law of motion is used to calculate what happens in situations involving forces and motion, and it shows the mathematical relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Mathematically, the second law is most often written asMathematically, the second law is most often written as

Note that $}$ and $ $ are the same because the net external force is the sum of all the external forces acting on the system.Note that $}$ and $ $ are the same because the net external force is the sum of all the external forces acting on the system.

First, what do we mean by a change in motion? A change in motion is simply a change in velocity: the speed of an object can become slower or faster, the direction in which the object is moving can change, or both of these variables may change. A change in velocity means, by definition, that an acceleration has occurred. Newton's first law says that only a nonzero net external force can cause a change in motion, so a net external force must cause an acceleration. Note that acceleration can refer to slowing down or to speeding up. Acceleration can also refer to a change in the direction of motion with no change in speed, because acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it takes for that change to occur, and velocity is defined by speed and direction.n the direction of motion with no change in speed, because acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it takes for that change to occur, and velocity is defined by speed and direction.

From the equation $}=m$ a, we see that force is directly proportional to both mass and acceleration, which makes sense. To accelerate two objects from rest to the same velocity, you would expect more force to be required to accelerate the more massive object. Likewise, for two objects of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a greater velocity.Likewise, for two objects of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a greater velocity.

Now, let's rearrange Newton's second law to solve for acceleration. We getWe get


}}{m}  { or } }{m}

}}{m}  { or } }{m}


In this form, we can see that acceleration is directly proportional to force, which we write asIn this form, we can see that acceleration is directly proportional to force, which we write as


  }

  }


where the symbol $ means proportional to.where the symbol $ means proportional to.

This proportionality mathematically states what we just said in words: acceleration is directly proportional to the net external
force. When two variables are directly proportional to each other, then if one variable doubles, the other variable must double. Likewise, if one variable is reduced by half, the other variable must also be reduced by half. In general, when one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable is also multiplied by the same number. It seems reasonable that the acceleration of a system should be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system. An object experiences greater acceleration when acted on by a greater force.An object experiences greater acceleration when acted on by a greater force.

It is also clear from the equation $} / m$ that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which we write asIt is also clear from the equation $} / m$ that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which we write as


  

  


Inversely proportional means that if one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable must be divided by the same number. Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 4.5, which shows that a given net external force applied to a basketball produces a much greater acceleration than when applied to a car.This relationship is illustrated in Figure 4.5, which shows that a given net external force applied to a basketball produces a much greater acceleration than when applied to a car.

Before putting Newton's second law into action, it is important to consider units. The equation $}=m $ is used to define the units of force in terms of the three basic units of mass, length, and time (recall that acceleration has units of length divided by time squared). The SI unit of force is called the newton (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate a 1-kg system at the rate of $1  / $. That is, because $}=m $, we haveThat is, because $}=m $, we have

One of the most important applications of Newton's second law is to calculate weight (also known as the gravitational force), which is usually represented mathematically as W. When people talk about gravity, they don't always realize that it is an acceleration. When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton's second law states that the net external force acting on an object is responsible for the acceleration of the object. If air resistance is negligible, the net external force on a falling object is only the gravitational force (i.e., the weight of the object).If air resistance is negligible, the net external force on a falling object is only the gravitational force (i.e., the weight of the object).

Weight can be represented by a vector because it has a direction. Down is defined as the direction in which gravity pulls, so weight is normally considered a downward force. By using Newton's second law, we can figure out the equation for weight.By using Newton's second law, we can figure out the equation for weight.

Consider an object with mass $m$ falling toward Earth. It experiences only the force of gravity (i.e., the gravitational force or weight), which is represented by W. Newton's second law states that $}=m $. Because the only force acting on the object is the gravitational force, we have $}=$. We know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is $$, so we have $$. Substituting these two expressions into Newton's second law givesSubstituting these two expressions into Newton's second law gives

Recall that although gravity acts downward, it can be assigned a positive or negative value, depending on what the positive direction is in your chosen coordinate system. Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight. When the downward direction is taken to be negative, as is often the case, acceleration due to gravity becomesWhen the downward direction is taken to be negative, as is often the case, acceleration due to gravity becomes

$=-9.8  / $.$=-9.8  / $.

When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in freefall. In this case, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. On the surface of Earth, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in freefall because there is always some upward force due to air resistance that acts on the object (and there is also the buoyancy force of air, which is similar to the buoyancy force in water that keeps boats afloat). there is always some upward force due to air resistance that acts on the object (and there is also the buoyancy force of air, which is similar to the buoyancy force in water that keeps boats afloat).

Gravity varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so the weight of an object depends very slightly on its location on Earth. Weight varies dramatically away from Earth's surface. On the moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only $1.67  / $. Because weight depends on the force of gravity, a 1.0-kg mass weighs $9.8 $ on Earth and only about $1.7 $ on the moon.Because weight depends on the force of gravity, a 1.0-kg mass weighs $9.8 $ on Earth and only about $1.7 $ on the moon.

It is important to remember that weight and mass are very different, although they are closely related. Mass is the quantity of matter (how much stuff) in an object and does not vary, but weight is the gravitational force on an object and is proportional to the force of gravity. It is easy to confuse the two, because our experience is confined to Earth, and the weight of an object is essentially the same no matter where you are on Earth. Adding to the confusion, the terms mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our medical records often show our weight in kilograms, but never in the correct unit of newtons.confusion, the terms mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our medical records often show our weight in kilograms, but never in the correct unit of newtons.

The acceleration is in the same direction as the net external force, which is parallel to the ground and to the right. There is no information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the motion, because we are given that the net external force is in the direction in which the person pushes. Also, the vertical forces must cancel if there is no acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally). The acceleration found is reasonable for a person pushing a mower; the mower's speed must increase by $0.21  / $ every second, which is possible. The time during which the mower accelerates would not be very long because the person's top speed would soon be reached. At this point, the person could push a little less hard, because he only has to overcome friction.At this point, the person could push a little less hard, because he only has to overcome friction.

Experiments such as this were performed in the early 1960 s to test the limits of human endurance and to test the apparatus designed to protect fighter pilots in emergency ejections. Speeds of $1000  / $ were obtained, with accelerations of $45 $. (Recall that $$, the acceleration due to gravity, is $9.80  / $. An acceleration of $45 $ is $45  9.80  / $, which is approximately $440  / $.) Living subjects are no longer used, and land speeds of 10,000 $ / $ have now been obtained with rocket sleds. In this example, as in the preceding example, the system of interest is clear. We will see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial—and that the choice is not always obvious.We will see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial—and that the choice is not always obvious.

If you have ever stubbed your toe, you have noticed that although your toe initiates the impact, the surface that you stub it on exerts a force back on your toe. Although the first thought that crosses your mind is probably "ouch, that hurt" rather than "this is a great example of Newton's third law," both statements are true.Although the first thought that crosses your mind is probably "ouch, that hurt" rather than "this is a great example of Newton's third law," both statements are true.

This is exactly what happens whenever one object exerts a force on another-each object experiences a force that is the same strength as the force acting on the other object but that acts in the opposite direction. Everyday experiences, such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball, are all perfect examples of Newton's third law in action.Everyday experiences, such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball, are all perfect examples of Newton's third law in action.

Newton's third law of motion states that whenever a first object exerts a force on a second object, the first object experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.hird law of motion states that whenever a first object exerts a force on a second object, the first object experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.

Newton's third law of motion tells us that forces always occur in pairs, and one object cannot exert a force on another without experiencing the same strength force in return. We sometimes refer to these force pairs as action-reaction pairs, where the force exerted is the action, and the force experienced in return is the reaction (although which is which depends on your point of view).refer to these force pairs as action-reaction pairs, where the force exerted is the action, and the force experienced in return is the reaction (although which is which depends on your point of view).

Newton's third law is useful for figuring out which forces are external to a system. Recall that identifying external forces is important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the net force.Recall that identifying external forces is important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the net force.

We can see Newton's third law at work by looking at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a pool, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. She pushes against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite to her push. The wall has thus exerted on the swimmer a force of equal magnitude but in the direction opposite that of her push. You might think that two forces of equal magnitude but that act in opposite directions would cancel, but they do not because they act on different systems.You might think that two forces of equal magnitude but that act in opposite directions would cancel, but they do not because they act on different systems.

In this case, there are two different systems that we could choose to investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we choose the swimmer to be the system of interest, as in the figure, then $}$ is an external force on the swimmer and affects her motion. Because acceleration is in the same direction as the net external force, the swimmer moves in the direction of $}$. Because the swimmer is our system (or object of interest) and not the wall, we do not need to consider the force $}$ because it originates from the swimmer rather than acting on the swimmer. Therefore, $}$ does not directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel $F_{ {wall on feet }}$. Note that the swimmer pushes in the direction opposite to the direction in which she wants to move.Note that the swimmer pushes in the direction opposite to the direction in which she wants to move.

Other examples of Newton's third law are easy to find. As a teacher paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force in the forward direction on the teacher that causes him to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the car's wheels in reaction to the car's wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks backward.You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks backward.

Another example is the force of a baseball as it makes contact with the bat. Helicopters create lift by pushing air down, creating an upward reaction force. Birds fly by exerting force on air in the direction opposite that in which they wish to fly. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself forward in the water by ejecting water backward through a funnel in its body, which is similar to how a jet ski is propelled. In these examples, the octopus or jet ski push the water backward, and the water, in turn, pushes the octopus or jet ski forward.In these examples, the octopus or jet ski push the water backward, and the water, in turn, pushes the octopus or jet ski forward.


Forces are classified and given names based on their source, how they are transmitted, or their effects. In previous sections, we discussed the forces called push, weight, and friction. In this section, applying Newton's third law of motion will allow us to explore three more forces: the normal force, tension, and thrust. However, because we haven't yet covered vectors in depth, we'll only consider one-dimensional situations in this chapter. Another chapter will consider forces acting in two dimensions.Another chapter will consider forces acting in two dimensions.

The gravitational force (or weight) acts on objects at all times and everywhere on Earth. We know from Newton's second law that a net force produces an acceleration; so, why is everything not in a constant state of freefall toward the center of Earth? The answer is the normal force. The normal force is the force that a surface applies to an object to support the weight of that object; it acts perpendicular to the surface upon which the object rests. If an object on a flat surface is not accelerating, the net external force is zero, and the normal force has the same magnitude as the weight of the system but acts in the opposite direction. In equation form, we write thatIn equation form, we write that

The word tension comes from the Latin word meaning to stretch. Tension is the force along the length of a flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, or cable. Regardless of the type of connector attached to the object of interest, one must remember that the connector can only pull (or exert tension) in the direction parallel to its length. Tension is a pull that acts parallel to the connector, and that acts in opposite directions at the two ends of the connector. This is possible because a flexible connector is simply a long series of action-reaction forces, except at the two ends where outside objects provide one member of the actionreaction forces.This is possible because a flexible connector is simply a long series of action-reaction forces, except at the two ends where outside objects provide one member of the actionreaction forces.

Figure 4.9 When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as a rope transmits a force $$, this force must be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull that such a flexible connector exerts is a tension. Note that the rope pulls with equal magnitude force but in opposite directions to the hand and to the mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). This is an example of Newton's third law. The rope is the medium that transmits forces of equal magnitude between the two objects but that act in opposite directions.The rope is the medium that transmits forces of equal magnitude between the two objects but that act in opposite directions.

Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we can prove by using Newton's second law. If the $5.00 $ mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, so $}=0$. The only external forces acting on the mass are its weight $$ and the tension $$ supplied by the rope.

Another example of Newton's third law in action is thrust. Rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at a high velocity. This means that the rocket exerts a large force backward on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the gas, in turn, exerts a large force forward on the rocket in response. This reaction force is called thrust.This reaction force is called thrust.


A common misconception is that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They actually work better in a vacuum, where they can expel exhaust gases more easily.They actually work better in a vacuum, where they can expel exhaust gases more easily.

First, identify the physical principles involved. If the problem involves forces, then Newton's laws of motion are involved, and it
is important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. An example of a sketch is shown in Figure 4.10. Next, as in Figure 4.10, use vectors to represent all forces. Label the forces carefully, and make sure that their lengths are proportional to the magnitude of the forces and that the arrows point in the direction in which the forces act.Label the forces carefully, and make sure that their lengths are proportional to the magnitude of the forces and that the arrows point in the direction in which the forces act.

(b) Arrows are used to represent all forces. $$ is the tension exerted on Tarzan by the vine, $}$ is the force exerted on the vine by Tarzan, and $$ is Tarzan's weight (i.e., the force exerted on Tarzan by Earth's gravity). All other forces, such as a nudge of a breeze, are assumed to be negligible. (c) Suppose we are given Tarzan's mass and asked to find the tension in the vine. We define the system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram, as shown in (d). $}$ is no longer shown because it does not act on the system of interest; rather, $}$ acts on the outside world. (d) The free-body diagram shows only the external forces acting on Tarzan. For these to sum to zero, we must have $$.For these to sum to zero, we must have $$.

Next, make a list of knowns and unknowns and assign variable names to the quantities given in the problem. Figure out which variables need to be calculated; these are the unknowns. Now carefully define the system: which objects are of interest for the problem. This decision is important, because Newton's second law involves only external forces. Once the system is identified, it's possible to see which forces are external and which are internal (see Figure 4.10).Once the system is identified, it's possible to see which forces are external and which are internal (see Figure 4.10).

If the system acts on an object outside the system, then you know that the outside object exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the system.If the system acts on an object outside the system, then you know that the outside object exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the system.

A diagram showing the system of interest and all the external forces acting on it is called a free-body diagram. Only external forces are shown on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. Figure 4.10 shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest.Figure 4.10 shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest.

After drawing a free-body diagram, apply Newton's second law to solve the problem. This is done in Figure 4.10 for the case of Tarzan hanging from a vine. When external forces are clearly identified in the free-body diagram, translate the forces into equation form and solve for the unknowns. Note that forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs. By convention, forces acting downward or to the left are usually negative.By convention, forces acting downward or to the left are usually negative.

According to Newton's third law, the floor exerts a forward force $}$ of $150 $ on the system.

None of the forces between components of the system, such as between the teacher's hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force because they are internal to the system. Another way to look at this is to note that the forces between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force exerted by the teacher on the cart is of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction of the force exerted by the cart on the teacher. In this case, both forces act on the same system, so they cancel. Defining the system was crucial to solving this problem.Defining the system was crucial to solving this problem.

INTRODUCTION In Chapter 2, we learned to distinguish between vectors and scalars; the difference being that a vector has magnitude and direction, whereas a scalar has only magnitude. We learned how to deal with vectors in physics by working straightforward one-dimensional vector problems, which may be treated mathematically in the same as scalars. In this chapter, we'll use vectors to expand our understanding of forces and motion into two dimensions. Most real-world physics problems (such as with the game of pool pictured here) are, after all, either two- or three-dimensional problems and physics is most useful when applied to real physical scenarios. We start by learning the practical skills of graphically adding and subtracting vectors (by using drawings) and analytically (with math). Once we're able to work with two-dimensional vectors, we apply these skills to problems of projectile motion, inclined planes, and harmonic motion.Once we're able to work with two-dimensional vectors, we apply these skills to problems of projectile motion, inclined planes, and harmonic motion.

Recall that a vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. For example, displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force are all vectors. In one-dimensional or straight-line motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. Motion that is forward, to the right, or upward is usually considered to be positive (+); and motion that is backward, to the left, or downward is usually considered to be negative (-).Motion that is forward, to the right, or upward is usually considered to be positive (+); and motion that is backward, to the left, or downward is usually considered to be negative (-).

In two dimensions, a vector describes motion in two perpendicular directions, such as vertical and horizontal. For vertical and horizontal motion, each vector is made up of vertical and horizontal components. In a one-dimensional problem, one of the components simply has a value of zero. For two-dimensional vectors, we work with vectors by using a frame of reference such as a coordinate system. Just as with one-dimensional vectors, we graphically represent vectors with an arrow having a length proportional to the vector's magnitude and pointing in the direction that the vector points.Just as with one-dimensional vectors, we graphically represent vectors with an arrow having a length proportional to the vector's magnitude and pointing in the direction that the vector points.

Figure 5.2 shows a graphical representation of a vector; the total displacement for a person walking in a city. The person first walks nine blocks east and then five blocks north. Her total displacement does not match her path to her final destination. The displacement simply connects her starting point with her ending point using a straight line, which is the shortest distance. We use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as $$, stands for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics, $D$, and its direction is given by an angle represented by the symbol $ Note that her displacement would be the same if she had begun by first walking five blocks north and then walking nine blocks east., and its direction is given by an angle represented by the symbol $ Note that her displacement would be the same if she had begun by first walking five blocks north and then walking nine blocks east.


In this text, we represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example, we represent a force with the vector $$, which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector is represented by the variable in italics, $F$, and the direction of the variable is given by the angle $The magnitude of the vector is represented by the variable in italics, $F$, and the direction of the variable is given by the angle $

The head-to-tail method is a graphical way to add vectors. The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the head (or tip) of a vector is the pointed end of the arrow. The following steps describe how to use the head-to-tail method for graphical vector addition.The following steps describe how to use the head-to-tail method for graphical vector addition.

There are two vectors $$ and $$. The head of vector $$ touches the tail of vector $$. The addition of vectors $$ and $$ gives a resultant vector $$.

a. Yes, if we add the same two vectors in a different order it will still give the same resultant vector.Yes, if we add the same two vectors in a different order it will still give the same resultant vector.

b. No, the resultant vector will change if we add the same vectors in a different order.No, the resultant vector will change if we add the same vectors in a different order.

Vector subtraction is done in the same way as vector addition with one small change. We add the first vector to the negative of the vector that needs to be subtracted. A negative vector has the same magnitude as the original vector, but points in the opposite direction (as shown in Figure 5.6). Subtracting the vector $$ from the vector $$, which is written as $$, is the same as $)$. Since it does not matter in what order vectors are added, $$ is also equal to $(-$. This is true for scalars as well as vectors. For example, $5-2=5+(-2)=(-2)+5$.For example, $5-2=5+(-2)=(-2)+5$.

Global angles are calculated in the counterclockwise direction. The clockwise direction is considered negative. For example, an angle of $30^{ south of west is the same as the global angle $210^{ which can also be expressed as $-150^{ from the positive $x$-axis.For example, an angle of $30^{ south of west is the same as the global angle $210^{ which can also be expressed as $-150^{ from the positive $x$-axis.


Now that we have the skills to work with vectors in two dimensions, we can apply vector addition to graphically determine the resultant vector, which represents the total force. Consider an example of force involving two ice skaters pushing a third as seen in Figure 5.7.Consider an example of force involving two ice skaters pushing a third as seen in Figure 5.7.

Figure 5.7 Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. Forces are vectors and add like vectors, so the total force on the third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater.In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater.

In problems where variables such as force are already known, the forces can be represented by making the length of the vectors proportional to the magnitudes of the forces. For this, you need to create a scale. For example, each centimeter of vector length could represent $50 $ worth of force. Once you have the initial vectors drawn to scale, you can then use the head-to-tail method to draw the resultant vector. The length of the resultant can then be measured and converted back to the original units using the scale you created.The length of the resultant can then be measured and converted back to the original units using the scale you created.

You can tell by looking at the vectors in the free-body diagram in Figure 5.7 that the two skaters are pushing on the third skater with equal-magnitude forces, since the length of their force vectors are the same. Note, however, that the forces are not equal because they act in different directions. If, for example, each force had a magnitude of $400 $, then we would find the magnitude of the total external force acting on the third skater by finding the magnitude of the resultant vector. Since the forces act at a right angle to one another, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a triangle with sides $, $, and $$, the Pythagorean theorem tells us thatFor a triangle with sides $, $, and $$, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that



& a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}

Note that, if the vectors were not at a right angle to each other $ to one another), we would not be able to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector. Another scenario where adding two-dimensional vectors is necessary is for velocity, where the direction may not be purely east-west or north-south, but some combination of these two directions. In the next section, we cover how to solve this type of problem analytically. For now let's consider the problem graphically.For now let's consider the problem graphically.



Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement of a person who walks the following three paths (displacements) on a flat field. First, he walks $25 $ in a direction $49^{ north of east. Then, he walks $23 $ heading $15^{ north of east. Finally, he turns and walks $32 $ in a direction $68^{ south of east.Finally, he turns and walks $32 $ in a direction $68^{ south of east.


Graphically represent each displacement vector with an arrow, labeling the first A, the second $$, and the third $$. Make the lengths proportional to the distance of the given displacement and orient the arrows as specified relative to an east-west line. Use the head-to-tail method outlined above to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, which we'll call $$.Use the head-to-tail method outlined above to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, which we'll call $$.

(4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of $$, remembering to convert back to the units of meters using the scale. Use a protractor to measure the direction of $$. While the direction of the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since $$ is south of the eastward pointing axis (the $x$-axis), we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector, as illustrated in Figure 5.11.Since $$ is south of the eastward pointing axis (the $x$-axis), we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector, as illustrated in Figure 5.11.

In this simulation (), you will experiment with adding vectors graphically. Click and drag the red vectors from the Grab One basket onto the graph in the middle of the screen. These red vectors can be rotated, stretched, or repositioned by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Check the Show Sum box to display the resultant vector (in green), which is the sum of all of the red vectors placed on the
graph. To remove a red vector, drag it to the trash or click the Clear All button if you wish to start over. Notice that, if you click on any of the vectors, the $||$ is its magnitude, $ is its direction with respect to the positive $x$-axis, $}$ is its horizontal component, and $R_{y}$ is its vertical component. You can check the resultant by lining up the vectors so that the head of the first vector touches the tail of the second. Continue until all of the vectors are aligned together head-to-tail. You will see that the resultant magnitude and angle is the same as the arrow drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. Rearrange the vectors in any order head-to-tail and compare. The resultant will always be the same.The resultant will always be the same.

For the analytical method of vector addition and subtraction, we use some simple geometry and trigonometry, instead of using a ruler and protractor as we did for graphical methods. However, the graphical method will still come in handy to visualize the problem by drawing vectors using the head-to-tail method. The analytical method is more accurate than the graphical method, which is limited by the precision of the drawing.

Atmospheric science is a physical science, meaning that it is a science based heavily on physics. Atmospheric science includes meteorology (the study of weather) and climatology (the study of climate). Climate is basically the average weather over a longer time scale. Weather changes quickly over time, whereas the climate changes more gradually.Weather changes quickly over time, whereas the climate changes more gradually.

The movement of air, water and heat is vitally important to climatology and meteorology. Since motion is such a major factor in weather and climate, this field uses vectors for much of its math.Since motion is such a major factor in weather and climate, this field uses vectors for much of its math.

Vectors are used to represent currents in the ocean, wind velocity and forces acting on a parcel of air. You have probably seen a weather map using vectors to show the strength (magnitude) and direction of the wind.You have probably seen a weather map using vectors to show the strength (magnitude) and direction of the wind.

Vectors used in atmospheric science are often three-dimensional. We won't cover three-dimensional motion in this text, but to go from two-dimensions to three-dimensions, you simply add a third vector component. Three-dimensional motion is represented as a combination of $x^{-}, y$ - and $z$ components, where $z$ is the altitude.Three-dimensional motion is represented as a combination of $x^{-}, y$ - and $z$ components, where $z$ is the altitude.

Vector calculus combines vector math with calculus, and is often used to find the rates of change in temperature, pressure or wind speed over time or distance. This is useful information, since atmospheric motion is driven by changes in pressure or temperature. The greater the variation in pressure over a given distance, the stronger the wind to try to correct that imbalance. Cold air tends to be more dense and therefore has higher pressure than warm air. Higher pressure air rushes into a region of lower pressure and gets deflected by the spinning of the Earth, and friction slows the wind at Earth's surface.Higher pressure air rushes into a region of lower pressure and gets deflected by the spinning of the Earth, and friction slows the wind at Earth's surface.

Finding how wind changes over distance and multiplying vectors lets meteorologists, like the one shown in Figure 5.26, figure out how much rotation (spin) there is in the atmosphere at any given time and location. This is an important tool for tornado prediction. Conditions with greater rotation are more likely to produce tornadoes.Conditions with greater rotation are more likely to produce tornadoes.

Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air. After the initial force that launches the object, it only experiences the force of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. As an object travels through the air, it encounters a frictional force that slows its motion called air resistance. Air resistance does significantly alter trajectory motion, but due to the difficulty in calculation, it is ignored in introductory physics.Air resistance does significantly alter trajectory motion, but due to the difficulty in calculation, it is ignored in introductory physics.

The most important concept in projectile motion is that horizontal and vertical motions are independent, meaning that they don't influence one another.

You can see that the cannonball in free fall falls at the same rate as the cannonball in projectile motion. Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would not line up perfectly.Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would not line up perfectly.

Since vertical and horizontal motions are independent, we can analyze them separately, along perpendicular axes. To do this, we separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical.To do this, we separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical.

As usual, we use velocity, acceleration, and displacement to describe motion. We must also find the components of these variables along the $x$ - and $y$-axes. The components of acceleration are then very simple $=-9.80  / $. Note that this definition defines the upwards direction as positive. Because gravity is vertical, $}=0$. Both accelerations are constant, so we can use the kinematic equations.

Figure 5.29 (a) We analyze two-dimensional projectile motion by breaking it into two independent one-dimensional motions along the vertical and horizontal axes. (b) The horizontal motion is simple, because $=0$ and $v_{x}$ is thus constant. (c) The velocity in the vertical direction begins to decrease as the object rises; at its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls towards the Earth again, the vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity.

Since we know the initial velocity, initial position, and the value of $}$ when the firework reaches its maximum height, we use the following equation to find $$Since we know the initial velocity, initial position, and the value of $}$ when the firework reaches its maximum height, we use the following equation to find $$

The horizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators.

Recall from the previous chapter that friction is a force that opposes motion, and is around us all the time. Friction allows us to move, which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice.Friction allows us to move, which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice.

There are different types of friction - kinetic and static. Kinetic friction acts on an object in motion, while static friction acts on an object or system at rest. The maximum static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects.The maximum static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects.

Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor. You may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do-it increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started because the kinetic friction force is less than the static friction force. If you were to add mass to the crate, (for example, by placing a box on top of it) you would need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. If, on the other hand, you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going.If, on the other hand, you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going.

Figure 5.33 shows how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Magnifying these surfaces shows that they are rough on the microscopic level. So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break off the points, or do both. The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them.The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them.

Since the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion, friction runs parallel to the surface between objects and perpendicular to the normal force.

We discussed previously that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight. Up until now, we dealt only with normal force in one dimension, with gravity and normal force acting perpendicular to the surface in opposing directions (gravity downward, and normal force upward). Now that you have the skills to work with forces in two dimensions, we can explore what happens to weight and the normal force on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane. For inclined plane problems, it is easier breaking down the forces into their components if we rotate the coordinate system, as illustrated in Figure 5.34.

When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle $ with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two components: A force acting perpendicular to the plane, $$, and a force acting parallel to the plane, $$. The perpendicular force of weight, $$, is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force, $$. The force acting parallel to the plane, $$, causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of friction, $$, opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane.The force of friction, $$, opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane.

Imagine a car parked against a wall. If a bulldozer pushes the car into the wall, the car will not move but it will noticeably change shape. A change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation. Even very small forces are known to cause some deformation. For small deformations, two important things can happen. First, unlike the car and bulldozer example, the object returns to its original shape when the force is removed. Second, the size of the deformation is proportional to the force. This
second property is known as Hooke's law. In equation form, Hooke's law isIn equation form, Hooke's law is







where $$ is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for example) produced by the restoring force $$, and $$ is a constant that depends on the shape and composition of the object. The restoring force is the force that brings the object back to its equilibrium position; the minus sign is there because the restoring force acts in the direction opposite to the displacement. Note that the restoring force is proportional to the deformation $$. The deformation can also be thought of as a displacement from equilibrium. It is a change in position due to a force. In the absence of force, the object would rest at its equilibrium position. The force constant $$ is related to the stiffness of a system. The larger the force constant, the stiffer the system. A stiffer system is more difficult to deform and requires a greater restoring force. The units of $$ are newtons per meter $( / )$.

Newton's first law implies that an object oscillating back and forth is experiencing forces. Without force, the object would move in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in Figure 5.38. The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a restoring force. Once released, the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position, where the net force on it is zero. However, by the time the ruler gets there, it gains momentum and continues to move to the right, producing the opposite deformation. It is then forced to the left, back through equilibrium, and the process is repeated until it gradually loses all of its energy. The simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. Recall that Hooke's law describes this situation with the equation $$. Therefore, Hooke's law describes and applies to the simplest case of oscillation, known as simple harmonic motion.Therefore, Hooke's law describes and applies to the simplest case of oscillation, known as simple harmonic motion.

When you pluck a guitar string, the resulting sound has a steady tone and lasts a long time. Each vibration of the string takes the same time as the previous one. Periodic motion is a motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as with an object bobbing up and down on a spring or a pendulum swinging back and forth. The time to complete one oscillation (a complete cycle of motion) remains constant and is called the period $T$. Its units are usually seconds.Its units are usually seconds.

Frequency $f$ is the number of oscillations per unit time. The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz), defined as the number of oscillations per second. The relationship between frequency and period isThe relationship between frequency and period is


f=1 / T

As you can see from the equation, frequency and period are different ways of expressing the same concept.

If there is no friction to slow it down, then an object in simple motion will oscillate forever with equal displacement on either side of the equilibrium position. The equilibrium position is where the object would naturally rest in the absence of force. The maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the amplitude $$. The units for amplitude and displacement are the same, but depend on the type of oscillation. For the object on the spring, shown in Figure 5.39, the units of amplitude and displacement are meters.For the object on the spring, shown in Figure 5.39, the units of amplitude and displacement are meters.

Figure 5.40 A simple pendulum has a small-diameter bob and a string that has a very small mass but is strong enough not to stretch. The linear displacement from equilibrium is $s$, the length of the arc. Also shown are the forces on the bob, which result in a net force of $-m g$ sin $ toward the equilibrium position-that is, a restoring force.Also shown are the forces on the bob, which result in a net force of $-m g$ sin $ toward the equilibrium position-that is, a restoring force.

Everyday examples of pendulums include old-fashioned clocks, a child's swing, or the sinker on a fishing line. For small displacements of less than 15 degrees, a pendulum experiences simple harmonic oscillation, meaning that its restoring force is directly proportional to its displacement. A pendulum in simple harmonic motion is called a simple pendulum. A pendulum has an object with a small mass, also known as the pendulum bob, which hangs from a light wire or string. The equilibrium position for a pendulum is where the angle $ is zero (that is, when the pendulum is hanging straight down). It makes sense that without any force applied, this is where the pendulum bob would rest.It makes sense that without any force applied, this is where the pendulum bob would rest.

The displacement of the pendulum bob is the arc length $s$. The weight $m g$ has components $m g   along the string and $m g$ sin $ tangent to the arc. Tension in the string exactly cancels the component $m g   parallel to the string. This leaves a net restoring force back toward the equilibrium position that runs tangent to the arc and equals $-m g  This leaves a net restoring force back toward the equilibrium position that runs tangent to the arc and equals $-m g

The only things that affect the period of a simple pendulum are its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The period is completely independent of other factors, such as mass or amplitude. However, note that $T$ does depend on $$. This means that if we know the length of a pendulum, we can actually use it to measure gravity!

INTRODUCTION You may recall learning about various aspects of motion along a straight line: kinematics (where we learned about displacement, velocity, and acceleration), projectile motion (a special case of two-dimensional kinematics), force, and Newton's laws of motion. In some ways, this chapter is a continuation of Newton's laws of motion. Recall that Newton's first law tells us that objects move along a straight line at constant speed unless a net external force acts on them. Therefore, if an object moves along a circular path, such as the car in the photo, it must be experiencing an external force. In this chapter, we explore both circular motion and rotational motion.In this chapter, we explore both circular motion and rotational motion.

What exactly do we mean by circular motion or rotation? Rotational motion is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. We will discuss specifically circular motion and spin. Circular motion is when an object moves in a circular path.Circular motion is when an object moves in a circular path.

Examples of circular motion include a race car speeding around a circular curve, a toy attached to a string swinging in a circle around your head, or the circular loop-the-loop on a roller coaster. Spin is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis, a wheel turning on its axle, the spin of a tornado on its path of destruction, or a figure skater spinning during a performance at the Olympics. Sometimes, objects will be spinning while in circular motion, like the Earth spinning on its axis while revolving around the Sun, but we will focus on these two motions separately.Sometimes, objects will be spinning while in circular motion, like the Earth spinning on its axis while revolving around the Sun, but we will focus on these two motions separately.

When solving problems involving rotational motion, we use variables that are similar to linear variables (distance, velocity, acceleration, and force) but take into account the curvature or rotation of the motion. Here, we define the angle of rotation, which is the angular equivalence of distance; and angular velocity, which is the angular equivalence of linear velocity.Here, we define the angle of rotation, which is the angular equivalence of distance; and angular velocity, which is the angular equivalence of linear velocity.

The angle of rotation is often measured by using a unit called the radian. (Radians are actually dimensionless, because a radian is defined as the ratio of two distances, radius and arc length.) A revolution is one complete rotation, where every point on the circle returns to its original position. One revolution covers $2  radians (or 360 degrees), and therefore has an angle of rotation of $2  radians, and an arc length that is the same as the circumference of the circle. We can convert between radians, revolutions, and degrees using the relationshipWe can convert between radians, revolutions, and degrees using the relationship

How fast is an object rotating? We can answer this question by using the concept of angular velocity. Consider first the angular speed $( is the rate at which the angle of rotation changes. In equation form, the angular speed isIn equation form, the angular speed is


{ t}

{ t}


which means that an angular rotation $(  occurs in a time, $ t$. If an object rotates through a greater angle of rotation in a given time, it has a greater angular speed. The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s).The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s).

Now let's consider the direction of the angular speed, which means we now must call it the angular velocity. The direction of the
angular velocity is along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating clockwise, the angular velocity points away from you along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating counterclockwise, the angular velocity points toward you along the axis of rotation.For an object rotating counterclockwise, the angular velocity points toward you along the axis of rotation.

Angular velocity $( is the angular version of linear velocity $$. Tangential velocity is the instantaneous linear velocity of an object in rotational motion. To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity, consider again a pit on the rotating $$. This pit moves through an arc length $( s)$ in a short time $( t)$ so its tangential speed isThis pit moves through an arc length $( s)$ in a short time $( t)$ so its tangential speed is


v={ t}

v={ t}


From the definition of the angle of rotation, $ {r}$, we see that $ s=r   Substituting this into the expression for $v$ givesFrom the definition of the angle of rotation, $ {r}$, we see that $ s=r   Substituting this into the expression for $v$ gives


v=  =r 

v=  =r 


The equation $v=r  says that the tangential speed $v$ is proportional to the distance $r$ from the center of rotation. Consequently, tangential speed is greater for a point on the outer edge of the $C D$ (with larger $r$ ) than for a point closer to the center of the $C D$ (with smaller $r$ ). This makes sense because a point farther out from the center has to cover a longer arc length in the same amount of time as a point closer to the center. Note that both points will still have the same angular speed, regardless of their distance from the center of rotation. See Figure 6.4.See Figure 6.4.

Now, consider another example: the tire of a moving car (see Figure 6.5). The faster the tire spins, the faster the car moves-large $ means large $v$ because $v=r  Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity, $$, will produce a greater linear (tangential) velocity, $$, for the car. This is because a larger radius means a longer arc length must contact the road, so the car must move farther in the same amount of time.This is because a larger radius means a longer arc length must contact the road, so the car must move farther in the same amount of time.

Figure $6.5 $ car moving at a velocity, $$, to the right has a tire rotating with angular velocity $$. The speed of the tread of the tire relative to the axle is $v$, the same as if the car were jacked up and the wheels spinning without touching the road. Directly below the axle, where the tire touches the road, the tire tread moves backward with respect to the axle with tangential velocity $v=r  where $r$ is the tire radius. Because the road is stationary with respect to this point of the tire, the car must move forward at the linear velocity $$. A larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater linear velocity for the car.A larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater linear velocity for the car.

However, there are cases where linear velocity and tangential velocity are not equivalent, such as a car spinning its tires on ice. In this case, the linear velocity will be less than the tangential velocity. Due to the lack of friction under the tires of a car on ice, the arc length through which the tire treads move is greater than the linear distance through which the car moves. It's similar to running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike; you are literally going nowhere fast.It's similar to running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike; you are literally going nowhere fast.


Angular velocity $$ and tangential velocity $$ are vectors, so we must include magnitude and direction. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation, and points away from you for an object rotating clockwise, and toward you for an object rotating counterclockwise. In mathematics this is described by the right-hand rule. Tangential velocity is usually described as up, down, left, right, north, south, east, or west, as shown in Figure 6.6.Tangential velocity is usually described as up, down, left, right, north, south, east, or west, as shown in Figure 6.6.

In the previous section, we defined circular motion. The simplest case of circular motion is uniform circular motion, where an object travels a circular path at a constant speed. Note that, unlike speed, the linear velocity of an object in circular motion is constantly changing because it is always changing direction. We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in magnitude or in direction or both. Therefore, an object undergoing uniform circular motion is always accelerating, even though the magnitude of its velocity is constant.Therefore, an object undergoing uniform circular motion is always accelerating, even though the magnitude of its velocity is constant.

You experience this acceleration yourself every time you ride in a car while it turns a corner. If you hold the steering wheel steady during the turn and move at a constant speed, you are executing uniform circular motion. What you notice is a feeling of sliding (or being flung, depending on the speed) away from the center of the turn. This isn't an actual force that is acting on you-it only happens because your body wants to continue moving in a straight line (as per Newton's first law) whereas the car is turning off this straight-line path. Inside the car it appears as if you are forced away from the center of the turn. This fictitious force is known as the centrifugal force. The sharper the curve and the greater your speed, the more noticeable this effect becomes.The sharper the curve and the greater your speed, the more noticeable this effect becomes.

Figure 6.7 shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed. The direction of the instantaneous tangential velocity is shown at two points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity; in this case it points roughly toward the center of rotation. (The center of rotation is at the center of the circular path). If we imagine $ s$ becoming smaller and smaller, then the acceleration would point exactly toward the center of rotation, but this case is hard to draw. We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion the centripetal acceleration $}$ because centripetal means center seeking.We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion the centripetal acceleration $}$ because centripetal means center seeking.

Now that we know that the direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of rotation, let's discuss the magnitude of centripetal acceleration. For an object traveling at speed $v$ in a circular path with radius $r$, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration isFor an object traveling at speed $v$ in a circular path with radius $r$, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is







Centripetal acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp curves (smaller radius), as you may have noticed when driving a car, because the car actually pushes you toward the center of the turn. But it is a bit surprising that $}$ is proportional to the speed squared. This means, for example, that the acceleration is four times greater when you take a curve at $100  / $ than at 50 $ / $.This means, for example, that the acceleration is four times greater when you take a curve at $100  / $ than at 50 $ / $.

We can also express $}$ in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity. Substituting $v=r  into the equation above, we get $a_{c}=}{r}=r $. Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity isTherefore, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity is

Because an object in uniform circular motion undergoes constant acceleration (by changing direction), we know from Newton's second law of motion that there must be a constant net external force acting on the object.ct in uniform circular motion undergoes constant acceleration (by changing direction), we know from Newton's second law of motion that there must be a constant net external force acting on the object.

Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth's gravity on the Moon, the friction between a road and the tires of a car as it goes around a curve, or the normal force of a roller coaster track on the cart during a loop-the-loop.he force of Earth's gravity on the Moon, the friction between a road and the tires of a car as it goes around a curve, or the normal force of a roller coaster track on the cart during a loop-the-loop.

Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force. The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of rotation, the same as for centripetal acceleration. According to Newton's second law of motion, a net force causes the acceleration of mass according to $}=$ ma . For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is centripetal acceleration: $}$. Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal force, $}$, is $}=m }$.Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal force, $}$, is $}=m }$.

By using the two different forms of the equation for the magnitude of centripetal acceleration, $ / r$ and $=r $, we get two expressions involving the magnitude of the centripetal force $}$. The first expression is in terms of tangential speed, the second is in terms of angular speed: $}=m $ and $}=m r $.The first expression is in terms of tangential speed, the second is in terms of angular speed: $}=m $ and $}=m r $.

Both forms of the equation depend on mass, velocity, and the radius of the circular path. You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Newton's second law also states that the object will accelerate in the same direction as the net force. By definition, the centripetal force is directed towards the center of rotation, so the object will also accelerate towards the center. A straight line drawn from the circular path to the center of the circle will always be perpendicular to the tangential velocity. Note that, if you solve the first expression for $r$, you getNote that, if you solve the first expression for $r$, you get

In the section on uniform circular motion, we discussed motion in a circle at constant speed and, therefore, constant angular velocity. However, there are times when angular velocity is not constant—rotational motion can speed up, slow down, or reverse directions. Angular velocity is not constant when a spinning skater pulls in her arms, when a child pushes a merry-go-round to make it rotate, or when a $C D$ slows to a halt when switched off. In all these cases, angular acceleration occurs because the angular velocity $$ changes. The faster the change occurs, the greater is the angular acceleration. Angular acceleration $$ is the rate of change of angular velocity. In equation form, angular acceleration isIn equation form, angular acceleration is

where $ $ is the change in angular velocity and $ t$ is the change in time. The units of angular acceleration are $( / ) / ,   /$ $s^{2}$. If $$ increases, then $$ is positive. If $$ decreases, then $$ is negative. Keep in mind that, by convention, counterclockwise is the positive direction and clockwise is the negative direction. For example, the skater in Figure 6.9 is rotating counterclockwise as seen from above, so her angular velocity is positive. Acceleration would be negative, for example, when an object that is rotating counterclockwise slows down. It would be positive when an object that is rotating counterclockwise speeds up.It would be positive when an object that is rotating counterclockwise speeds up.

These equations mean that the magnitudes of tangential acceleration and angular acceleration are directly proportional to each other. The greater the angular acceleration, the larger the change in tangential acceleration, and vice versa. For example, consider riders in their pods on a Ferris wheel at rest. A Ferris wheel with greater angular acceleration will give the riders greater tangential acceleration because, as the Ferris wheel increases its rate of spinning, it also increases its tangential velocity. Note that the radius of the spinning object also matters. For example, for a given angular acceleration $$, a smaller Ferris wheel leads to a smaller tangential acceleration for the riders.For example, for a given angular acceleration $$, a smaller Ferris wheel leads to a smaller tangential acceleration for the riders.


Tangential acceleration is sometimes denoted $}$. It is a linear acceleration in a direction tangent to the circle at the point of interest in circular or rotational motion. Remember that tangential acceleration is parallel to the tangential velocity (either in the same direction or in the opposite direction.) Centripetal acceleration is always perpendicular to the tangential velocity.tangential acceleration is parallel to the tangential velocity (either in the same direction or in the opposite direction.)

We can now begin to see how rotational quantities like $ $, and $$ are related to each other. For example, if a motorcycle wheel that starts at rest has a large angular acceleration for a fairly long time, it ends up spinning rapidly and rotates through many revolutions. Putting this in terms of the variables, if the wheel's angular acceleration $$ is large for a long period of time $t$, then the final angular velocity $$ and angle of rotation $ are large. In the case of linear motion, if an object starts at rest and undergoes a large linear acceleration, then it has a large final velocity and will have traveled a large distance.In the case of linear motion, if an object starts at rest and undergoes a large linear acceleration, then it has a large final velocity and will have traveled a large distance.

The kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships between the angle of rotation, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time. It only describes motion —it does not include any forces or masses that may affect rotation (these are part of dynamics). Recall the kinematics equation for linear motion: $ t$ (constant $$ ).Recall the kinematics equation for linear motion: $ t$ (constant $$ ).

Figure 6.10 Tornadoes descend from clouds in funnel-like shapes that spin violently. (Daphne Zaras, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)

Storm chasers tend to fall into one of three groups: Amateurs chasing tornadoes as a hobby, atmospheric scientists gathering data for research, weather watchers for news media, or scientists having fun under the guise of work. Storm chasing is a dangerous pastime because tornadoes can change course rapidly with little warning. Since storm chasers follow in the wake of the destruction left by tornadoes, changing flat tires due to debris left on the highway is common. The most active part of the world for tornadoes, called tornado alley, is in the central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains.The most active part of the world for tornadoes, called tornado alley, is in the central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains.

Tornadoes are perfect examples of rotational motion in action in nature. They come out of severe thunderstorms called supercells, which have a column of air rotating around a horizontal axis, usually about four miles across. The difference in wind speeds between the strong cold winds higher up in the atmosphere in the jet stream and weaker winds traveling north from the Gulf of Mexico causes the column of rotating air to shift so that it spins around a vertical axis, creating a tornado. up in the atmosphere in the jet stream and weaker winds traveling north from the Gulf of Mexico causes the column of rotating air to shift so that it spins around a vertical axis, creating a tornado.

Tornadoes produce wind speeds as high as $500  / $ (approximately $300  / $ ), particularly at the bottom where the funnel is narrowest because the rate of rotation increases as the radius decreases. They blow houses away as if they were made of paper and have been known to pierce tree trunks with pieces of straw.They blow houses away as if they were made of paper and have been known to pierce tree trunks with pieces of straw.

If you have ever spun a bike wheel or pushed a merry-go-round, you know that force is needed to change angular velocity. The farther the force is applied from the pivot point (or fulcrum), the greater the angular acceleration. For example, a door opens slowly if you push too close to its hinge, but opens easily if you push far from the hinges. Furthermore, we know that the more
massive the door is, the more slowly it opens; this is because angular acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. These relationships are very similar to the relationships between force, mass, and acceleration from Newton's second law of motion. Since we have already covered the angular versions of distance, velocity and time, you may wonder what the angular version of force is, and how it relates to linear force.Since we have already covered the angular versions of distance, velocity and time, you may wonder what the angular version of force is, and how it relates to linear force.

The lever arm is the vector from the point of rotation (pivot point or fulcrum) to the location where force is applied. Since the magnitude of the lever arm is a distance, its units are in meters, and torque has units of $  $.

Applying a stronger torque will produce a greater angular acceleration. For example, the harder the man pushes the merry-goround in Figure 6.11, the faster it accelerates. Furthermore, the more massive the merry-go-round is, the slower it accelerates for the same torque. If the man wants to maximize the effect of his force on the merry-go-round, he should push as far from the center as possible to get the largest lever arm and, therefore, the greatest torque and angular acceleration. Torque is also maximized when the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm.Torque is also maximized when the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm.


Just as linear forces can balance to produce zero net force and no linear acceleration, the same is true of rotational motion. When two torques of equal magnitude act in opposing directions, there is no net torque and no angular acceleration, as you can see in the following video. If zero net torque acts on a system spinning at a constant angular velocity, the system will continue to spin at the same angular velocity.If zero net torque acts on a system spinning at a constant angular velocity, the system will continue to spin at the same angular velocity.



This video () defines torque in terms of moment arm (which is the same as lever arm). It also covers a problem with forces acting in opposing directions about a pivot point. (At this stage, you can ignore Sal's references to work and mechanical advantage.)(At this stage, you can ignore Sal's references to work and mechanical advantage.)

Now let's look at examples applying rotational kinematics to a fishing reel and the concept of torque to a merry-go-round.Now let's look at examples applying rotational kinematics to a fishing reel and the concept of torque to a merry-go-round.



A deep-sea fisherman uses a fishing rod with a reel of radius $4.50 $. A big fish takes the bait and swims away from the boat, pulling the fishing line from his fishing reel. As the fishing line unwinds from the reel, the reel spins at an angular velocity of 220 $ / $. The fisherman applies a brake to the spinning reel, creating an angular acceleration of $-300  / $. How long does it take the reel to come to a stop?How long does it take the reel to come to a stop?

We are asked to find the time $t$ for the reel to come to a stop. The magnitude of the initial angular velocity is $=220  / $, and the magnitude of the final angular velocity $=0$. The signed magnitude of the angular acceleration is $=-300  / $, where the minus sign indicates that it acts in the direction opposite to the angular velocity. Looking at the rotational kinematic equations, we see all quantities but $t$ are known in the equation $ t$, making it the easiest equation to use for this problem.Looking at the rotational kinematic equations, we see all quantities but $t$ are known in the equation $ t$, making it the easiest equation to use for this problem.

The time to stop the reel is fairly small because the acceleration is fairly large. Fishing lines sometimes snap because of the forces involved, and fishermen often let the fish swim for a while before applying brakes on the reel. A tired fish will be slower, requiring a smaller acceleration and therefore a smaller force.A tired fish will be slower, requiring a smaller acceleration and therefore a smaller force.

The motion of all celestial objects, in fact, is determined by the gravitational force, which depends on their mass and separation.The motion of all celestial objects, in fact, is determined by the gravitational force, which depends on their mass and separation.

Johannes Kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion that all orbiting planets and moons follow. Years later, Isaac Newton found these laws useful in developing his law of universal gravitation. This law relates gravitational force to the masses of objects and the distance between them. Many years later still, Albert Einstein showed there was a little more to the gravitation story when he published his theory of general relativity.Many years later still, Albert Einstein showed there was a little more to the gravitation story when he published his theory of general relativity.

Examples of orbits abound. Hundreds of artificial satellites orbit Earth together with thousands of pieces of debris. The moon's orbit around Earth has intrigued humans from time immemorial. The orbits of planets, asteroids, meteors, and comets around the sun are no less interesting. If we look farther, we see almost unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects orbiting one another and interacting through gravity.If we look farther, we see almost unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects orbiting one another and interacting through gravity.

All these motions are governed by gravitational force. The orbital motions of objects in our own solar system are simple enough to describe with a few fairly simple laws. The orbits of planets and moons satisfy the following two conditions:The orbits of planets and moons satisfy the following two conditions:


   The mass of the orbiting object, $m$, is small compared to the mass of the object it orbits, $M$.
   The system is isolated from other massive objects.

Based on the motion of the planets about the sun, Kepler devised a set of three classical laws, called Kepler's laws of planetary motion, that describe the orbits of all bodies satisfying these two conditions:the motion of the planets about the sun, Kepler devised a set of three classical laws, called Kepler's laws of planetary motion, that describe the orbits of all bodies satisfying these two conditions:

The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets about the sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distances from the sun.



These descriptive laws are named for the German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630). He devised them after careful study (over some 20 years) of a large amount of meticulously recorded observations of planetary motion done by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601). Such careful collection and detailed recording of methods and data are hallmarks of good science. Data constitute the evidence from which new interpretations and meanings can be constructed. Let's look closer at each of these laws.Let's look closer at each of these laws.


The orbit of each planet about the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus, as shown in Figure 7.2.

Before the discoveries of Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others, the solar system was thought to revolve around Earth as shown in Figure 7.5 (a). This is called the Ptolemaic model, named for the Greek philosopher Ptolemy who lived in the second century AD. The Ptolemaic model is characterized by a list of facts for the motions of planets, with no explanation of cause and effect. There tended to be a different rule for each heavenly body and a general lack of simplicity.There tended to be a different rule for each heavenly body and a general lack of simplicity.

Figure 7.5 (b) represents the modern or Copernican model. In this model, a small set of rules and a single underlying force explain not only all planetary motion in the solar system, but also all other situations involving gravity. The breadth and simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling.The breadth and simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling.

Figure 7.5 (a) The Ptolemaic model of the universe has Earth at the center with the moon, the planets, the sun, and the stars revolving about it in complex circular paths. This geocentric (Earth-centered) model, which can be made progressively more accurate by adding more circles, is purely descriptive, containing no hints about the causes of these motions. (b) The Copernican heliocentric (sun-centered) model is a simpler and more accurate model.(b) The Copernican heliocentric (sun-centered) model is a simpler and more accurate model.

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) first had the idea that the planets circle the sun, in about 1514. It took him almost 20 years to work out the mathematical details for his model. He waited another 10 years or so to publish his work. It is thought he hesitated because he was afraid people would make fun of his theory. Actually, the reaction of many people was more one of fear and anger. Many people felt the Copernican model threatened their basic belief system. About 100 years later, the astronomer Galileo was put under house arrest for providing evidence that planets, including Earth, orbited the sun. In all, it took almost 300 years for everyone to admit that Copernicus had been right all along.In all, it took almost 300 years for everyone to admit that Copernicus had been right all along.

Refer back to Figure 7.2 (a). Notice which distances are constant. The foci are fixed, so distance $ f_{2}}$ is a constant. The definition of an ellipse states that the sum of the distances $ m}+}$ is also constant. These two facts taken together mean that the perimeter of triangle $ f_{1} m f_{2}$ must also be constant. Knowledge of these constants will help you determine positions and distances of objects in a system that includes one object orbiting another.Knowledge of these constants will help you determine positions and distances of objects in a system that includes one object orbiting another.


Refer back to Figure 7.4. The second law says that the segments have equal area and that it takes equal time to sweep through each segment. That is, the time it takes to travel from $A$ to $B$ equals the time it takes to travel from $C$ to $D$, and so forth. Velocity $$ equals distance $d$ divided by time $t: =d / t$. Then, $t=d / $, so distance divided by velocity is also a constant. For example, if we know the average velocity of Earth on June 21 and December 21, we can compare the distance Earth travels on those days.For example, if we know the average velocity of Earth on June 21 and December 21, we can compare the distance Earth travels on those days.

At its closest approach, a moon comes within $200,000 $ of the planet it orbits. At that point, the moon is $300,000 $ from the other focus of its orbit, $f_{2}$.

Each day, Earth sweeps past an equal-sized area, so we divide the total area by the number of days in a year to find the area swept past in one day. For total area use $A= a b$.

The height of the artificial satellite above Earth's surface is given, so to get the distance $r_{2}$ from the center of Earth we must add the height to the radius of Earth $(6380 )$.

Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See Figure 7.7. But Newton was not the first to suspect that the same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner, Galileo Galilei, had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton's contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections-circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a major triumph. It had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose an explanation of the mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others.d been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose an explanation of the mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others.

Figure 7.7 The popular legend that Newton suddenly discovered the law of universal gravitation when an apple fell from a tree and hit him on the head has an element of truth in it. A more probable account is that he was walking through an orchard and wondered why all the apples fell in the same direction with the same acceleration. Great importance is attached to it because Newton's universal law of gravitation and his laws of motion answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying simplicity and unity in nature. Scientists still expect underlying simplicity to emerge from their ongoing inquiries into nature.Scientists still expect underlying simplicity to emerge from their ongoing inquiries into nature.

The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance
between them. Expressed in modern language, Newton's universal law of gravitation states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directed along a line joining them. The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This attraction is illustrated by Figure 7.8.This attraction is illustrated by Figure 7.8.

For two bodies having masses $m$ and $M$ with a distance $r$ between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton's universal law of gravitation isFor two bodies having masses $m$ and $M$ with a distance $r$ between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton's universal law of gravitation is

where $$ is the magnitude of the gravitational force and $G$ is a proportionality factor called the gravitational constant. $G$ is a universal constant, meaning that it is thought to be the same everywhere in the universe.

If a person has a mass of $60.0 $, what would be the force of gravitational attraction on him at Earth's surface? $G$ is given above, Earth's mass $M$ is $5.97  10^{24} $, and the radius $r$ of Earth is $6.38  10^{6} $.

This is a good point to recall the difference between mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the
force of attraction between the mass within two objects. Weight can change because $g$ is different on every moon and planet. An object's mass $m$ does not change but its weight $m$ g can.An object's mass $m$ does not change but its weight $m$ g can.

It is possible to derive Kepler's third law from Newton's law of universal gravitation. Applying Newton's second law of motion to
angular motion gives an expression for centripetal force, which can be equated to the expression for force in the universal gravitation equation. This expression can be manipulated to produce the equation for Kepler's third law. We saw earlier that the expression $r^{3} / T^{2}$ is a constant for satellites orbiting the same massive object.

The universal gravitational constant $G$ is determined experimentally. This definition was first done accurately in 1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish (1731-1810), more than 100 years after Newton published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of $G$ is very basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces in nature. Cavendish's experiment was very difficult because he measured the tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (tens of kilograms at most) by using an apparatus like that in Figure 7.9. Remarkably, his value for $G$ differs by less than $1  from the modern value.Remarkably, his value for $G$ differs by less than $1  from the modern value.

Einstein's theory of general relativity explained some interesting properties of gravity not covered by Newton's theory. Einstein based his theory on the postulate that acceleration and gravity have the same effect and cannot be distinguished from each other. He concluded that light must fall in both a gravitational field and in an accelerating reference frame. Figure 7.10 shows this effect (greatly exaggerated) in an accelerating elevator. In Figure 7.10(a), the elevator accelerates upward in zero gravity. In Figure 7.10(b), the room is not accelerating but is subject to gravity. The effect on light is the same: it "falls" downward in both situations. The person in the elevator cannot tell whether the elevator is accelerating in zero gravity or is stationary and subject to gravity. Thus, gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses, while photons are massless.Thus, gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses, while photons are massless.

Einstein's theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the sun was observed during a solar eclipse. (See Figure 7.11.) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those on a line of sight nearest the sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein's predictions well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass or energy (e.g., massless photons) is affected by gravity.

Figure 7.11 This schematic shows how light passing near a massive body like the sun is curved toward it. The light that reaches the Earth then seems to be coming from different locations than the known positions of the originating stars. Not only was this effect observed, but the amount of bending was precisely what Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity.Not only was this effect observed, but the amount of bending was precisely what Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity.

To summarize the two views of gravity, Newton envisioned gravity as a tug of war along the line connecting any two objects in the universe. In contrast, Einstein envisioned gravity as a bending of space-time by mass.In contrast, Einstein envisioned gravity as a bending of space-time by mass.

Two equations involving the gravitational constant, $G$, are often useful. The first is Newton's equation, $=G {r^{2}}$. Several of the values in this equation are either constants or easily obtainable. $$ is often the weight of an object on the surface of a large object with mass $M$, which is usually known. The mass of the smaller object, $m$, is often known, and $G$ is a universal constant with the same value anywhere in the universe. This equation can be used to solve problems involving an object on or orbiting Earth or other massive celestial object. Sometimes it is helpful to equate the right-hand side of the equation to $$ and cancel the $m$ on both sides.Sometimes it is helpful to equate the right-hand side of the equation to $$ and cancel the $m$ on both sides.

The equation ${4 }$ is also useful for problems involving objects in orbit. Note that there is no need to know the mass of the object. Often, we know the radius $r$ or the period $T$ and want to find the other. If these are both known, we can use the equation to calculate the mass of a planet or star.If these are both known, we can use the equation to calculate the mass of a planet or star.

INTRODUCTION We know from everyday use of the word momentum that it is a tendency to continue on course in the same direction. Newscasters speak of sports teams or politicians gaining, losing, or maintaining the momentum to win. As we learned when studying about inertia, which is Newton's first law of motion, every object or system has inertia-that is, a tendency for an object in motion to remain in motion or an object at rest to remain at rest. Mass is a useful variable that lets us quantify inertia. Momentum is mass in motion.Momentum is mass in motion.

Momentum is important because it is conserved in isolated systems; this fact is convenient for solving problems where objects collide. The magnitude of momentum grows with greater mass and/or speed. For example, look at the football players in the photograph (Figure 8.1). They collide and fall to the ground. During their collisions, momentum will play a large part. In this chapter, we will learn about momentum, the different types of collisions, and how to use momentum equations to solve collision problems.In this chapter, we will learn about momentum, the different types of collisions, and how to use momentum equations to solve collision problems.

Linear momentum is the product of a system's mass and its velocity. In equation form, linear momentum $$ isIn equation form, linear momentum $$ is

You can see from the equation that momentum is directly proportional to the object's mass $(m)$ and velocity $()$. Therefore, the greater an object's mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. A large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object.A large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object.

Momentum is a vector and has the same direction as velocity $$. Since mass is a scalar, when velocity is in a negative direction (i.e., opposite the direction of motion), the momentum will also be in a negative direction; and when velocity is in a positive direction, momentum will likewise be in a positive direction. The SI unit for momentum is $  / $.The SI unit for momentum is $  / $.

Momentum is so important for understanding motion that it was called the quantity of motion by physicists such as Newton. Force influences momentum, and we can rearrange Newton's second law of motion to show the relationship between force and momentum.Force influences momentum, and we can rearrange Newton's second law of motion to show the relationship between force and momentum.

Recall our study of Newton's second law of motion $}=m  Newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. The change in momentum is the difference between the final and initial values of momentum.The change in momentum is the difference between the final and initial values of momentum.

$}  t$ is known as impulse and this equation is known as the impulse-momentum theorem. From the equation, we see that the impulse equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. It is equal to the change in momentum. The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as the strength of the force. Impulse is a useful concept because it quantifies the effect of a force. A very large force acting for a short time can have a great effect on the momentum of an object, such as the force of a racket hitting a tennis ball. A small force could cause the same change in momentum, but it would have to act for a much longer time.A small force could cause the same change in momentum, but it would have to act for a much longer time.


When Newton's second law is expressed in terms of momentum, it can be used for solving problems where mass varies, since $ = )$. In the more traditional form of the law that you are used to working with, mass is assumed to be constant. In fact, this traditional form is a special case of the law, where mass is constant. $}=m $ is actually derived from the equation:$}=m $ is actually derived from the equation:

Cars during the past several decades have gotten much safer. Seat belts play a major role in automobile safety by preventing people from flying into the windshield in the event of a crash. Other safety features, such as airbags, are less visible or obvious, but are also effective at making auto crashes less deadly (see Figure 8.2). Many of these safety features make use of the concept of impulse from physics. Recall that impulse is the net force multiplied by the duration of time of the impact. This was expressed mathematically as $ }  t$.This was expressed mathematically as $ }  t$.

Airbags allow the net force on the occupants in the car to act over a much longer time when there is a sudden stop. The momentum change is the same for an occupant whether an airbag is deployed or not. But the force that brings the occupant to a stop will be much less if it acts over a larger time. By rearranging the equation for impulse to solve for force $}=}{ t}$, you can see how increasing $ t$ while $ $ stays the same will decrease $}$. This is another example of an inverse relationship. Similarly, a padded dashboard increases the time over which the force of impact acts, thereby reducing the force of impact.Similarly, a padded dashboard increases the time over which the force of impact acts, thereby reducing the force of impact.

Cars today have many plastic components. One advantage of plastics is their lighter weight, which results in better gas mileage. Another advantage is that a car will crumple in a collision, especially in the event of a head-on collision. A longer collision time means the force on the occupants of the car will be less. Deaths during car races decreased dramatically when the rigid frames of racing cars were replaced with parts that could crumple or collapse in the event of an accident.Deaths during car races decreased dramatically when the rigid frames of racing cars were replaced with parts that could crumple or collapse in the event of an accident.

It is important we realize that momentum is conserved during collisions, explosions, and other events involving objects in motion. To say that a quantity is conserved means that it is constant throughout the event. In the case of conservation of momentum, the total momentum in the system remains the same before and after the collision.In the case of conservation of momentum, the total momentum in the system remains the same before and after the collision.

You may have noticed that momentum was not conserved in some of the examples previously presented in this chapter. where forces acting on the objects produced large changes in momentum. Why is this? The systems of interest considered in those problems were not inclusive enough. If the systems were expanded to include more objects, then momentum would in fact be conserved in those sample problems. It is always possible to find a larger system where momentum is conserved, even though momentum changes for individual objects within the system.It is always possible to find a larger system where momentum is conserved, even though momentum changes for individual objects within the system.

For example, if a football player runs into the goalpost in the end zone, a force will cause him to bounce backward. His momentum is obviously greatly changed, and considering only the football player, we would find that momentum is not conserved. However, the system can be expanded to contain the entire Earth. Surprisingly, Earth also recoils—conserving momentum-because of the force applied to it through the goalpost. The effect on Earth is not noticeable because it is so much more massive than the player, but the effect is real.The effect on Earth is not noticeable because it is so much more massive than the player, but the effect is real.

Next, consider what happens if the masses of two colliding objects are more similar than the masses of a football player and Earth-in the example shown in Figure 8.4 of one car bumping into another. Both cars are coasting in the same direction when the lead car, labeled $m_{2}$, is bumped by the trailing car, labeled $m_{1}$. The only unbalanced force on each car is the force of the collision, assuming that the effects due to friction are negligible. Car $m 1$ slows down as a result of the collision, losing some momentum, while car $ 2$ speeds up and gains some momentum. If we choose the system to include both cars and assume that friction is negligible, then the momentum of the two-car system should remain constant. Now we will prove that the total momentum of the two-car system does in fact remain constant, and is therefore conserved.Now we will prove that the total momentum of the two-car system does in fact remain constant, and is therefore conserved.

Figure 8.4 Car of mass $m_{1}$ moving with a velocity of $$ bumps into another car of mass $m_{2}$ and velocity $$. As a result, the first car slows down to a velocity of $_{1}$ and the second speeds up to a velocity of $_{2}$. The momentum of each car is changed, but the total momentum $}$ of the two cars is the same before and after the collision if you assume friction is negligible.The momentum of each car is changed, but the total momentum $}$ of the two cars is the same before and after the collision if you assume friction is negligible.

Using the impulse-momentum theorem, the change in momentum of car 1 is given byUsing the impulse-momentum theorem, the change in momentum of car 1 is given by

Similarly, the change in momentum of car 2 is $   t$ where $$ is the force on car 2 due to car 1 , and we assume the duration of the collision $ t$ is the same for both cars. We know from Newton's third law of motion that $$, and so $   t=- $.We know from Newton's third law of motion that $$, and so $   t=- $.

Therefore, the changes in momentum are equal and opposite, and $ + =0$.Therefore, the changes in momentum are equal and opposite, and $ + =0$.

where $$ and $$ are the momenta of cars 1 and 2 after the collision.where $$ and $$ are the momenta of cars 1 and 2 after the collision.

This result that momentum is conserved is true not only for this example involving the two cars, but for any system where the net external force is zero, which is known as an isolated system. The law of conservation of momentum states that for an isolated system with any number of objects in it, the total momentum is conserved. In equation form, the law of conservation of momentum for an isolated system is written asIn equation form, the law of conservation of momentum for an isolated system is written as

The conservation of momentum principle can be applied to systems as diverse as a comet striking the Earth or a gas containing huge numbers of atoms and molecules. Conservation of momentum appears to be violated only when the net external force is not zero. But another larger system can always be considered in which momentum is conserved by simply including the source of the external force. For example, in the collision of two cars considered above, the two-car system conserves momentum while each one-car system does not.For example, in the collision of two cars considered above, the two-car system conserves momentum while each one-car system does not.

So far we have covered linear momentum, which describes the inertia of objects traveling in a straight line. But we know that many objects in nature have a curved or circular path. Just as linear motion has linear momentum to describe its tendency to move forward, circular motion has the equivalent angular momentum to describe how rotational motion is carried forward.Just as linear motion has linear momentum to describe its tendency to move forward, circular motion has the equivalent angular momentum to describe how rotational motion is carried forward.

This is similar to how torque is analogous to force, angular acceleration is analogous to translational acceleration, and $m r^{2}$ is analogous to mass or inertia. You may recall learning that the quantity $m r^{2}$ is called the rotational inertia or moment of inertia of a point mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of rotation.You may recall learning that the quantity $m r^{2}$ is called the rotational inertia or moment of inertia of a point mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of rotation.

We already know the equation for linear momentum, $=m $. Since angular momentum is analogous to linear momentum, the moment of inertia $(I)$ is analogous to mass, and angular velocity $()$ is analogous to linear velocity, it makes sense that angular momentum $()$ is defined asum is analogous to linear momentum, the moment of inertia $(I)$ is analogous to mass, and angular velocity $()$ is analogous to linear velocity, it makes sense that angular momentum $()$ is defined as

Figure skaters take advantage of the conservation of angular momentum, likely without even realizing it. In Figure 8.5, a figure skater is executing a spin. The net torque on her is very close to zero, because there is relatively little friction between her skates and the ice, and because the friction is exerted very close to the pivot point. Both $$ and $r$ are small, and so $$ is negligibly small.Both $$ and $r$ are small, and so $$ is negligibly small.

In an elastic collision, the objects separate after impact and don't lose any of their kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is covered in detail elsewhere.

Perfectly elastic collisions can happen only with subatomic particles. Everyday observable examples of perfectly elastic collisions don't exist-some kinetic energy is always lost, as it is converted into heat transfer due to friction. However, collisions between everyday objects are almost perfectly elastic when they occur with objects and surfaces that are nearly frictionless, such as with two steel blocks on ice.However, collisions between everyday objects are almost perfectly elastic when they occur with objects and surfaces that are nearly frictionless, such as with two steel blocks on ice.

Now, let us turn to the second type of collision. An inelastic collision is one in which objects stick together after impact, and kinetic energy is not conserved. This lack of conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may convert kinetic energy to other forms of energy, such as potential energy or thermal energy. The concepts of energy are discussed more thoroughly elsewhere. For inelastic collisions, kinetic energy may be lost in the form of heat. Figure 8.7 shows an example of an inelastic collision. Two objects that have equal masses head toward each other at equal speeds and then stick together. The two objects come to rest after sticking together, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy after they collide. Some of the energy of motion gets converted to thermal energy, or heat.Some of the energy of motion gets converted to thermal energy, or heat.

Here's a trick for remembering which collisions are elastic and which are inelastic: Elastic is a bouncy material, so when objects bounce off one another in the collision and separate, it is an elastic collision.

The Khan Academy videos referenced in this section show examples of elastic and inelastic collisions in one dimension. In onedimensional collisions, the incoming and outgoing velocities are all along the same line. But what about collisions, such as those between billiard balls, in which objects scatter to the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and just as we did with twodimensional forces, we will solve these problems by first choosing a coordinate system and separating the motion into its $x$ and $y$ components.two-dimensional collisions, and just as we did with twodimensional forces, we will solve these problems by first choosing a coordinate system and separating the motion into its $x$ and $y$ components.

One complication with two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might rotate before or after their collision. For example, if two ice skaters hook arms as they pass each other, they will spin in circles. We will not consider such rotation until later, and so for now, we arrange things so that no rotation is possible. To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering of point masses-that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin.To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering of point masses-that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin.

We start by assuming that $}=0$, so that momentum $$ is conserved. The simplest collision is one in which one of the particles is initially at rest. The best choice for a coordinate system is one with an axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle, as shown in Figure 8.8.

INTRODUCTION Roller coasters have provided thrills for daring riders around the world since the nineteenth century. Inventors of roller coasters used simple physics to build the earliest examples using railroad tracks on mountainsides and old mines. Modern roller coaster designers use the same basic laws of physics to create the latest amusement park favorites. Physics principles are used to engineer the machines that do the work to lift a roller coaster car up its first big incline before it is set loose to roll. Engineers also have to understand the changes in the car's energy that keep it speeding over hills, through twists, turns, and even loops.Engineers also have to understand the changes in the car's energy that keep it speeding over hills, through twists, turns, and even loops.

In physics, the term work has a very specific definition. Work is application of force, $$, to move an object over a distance, $d$, in the direction that the force is applied. Work, $W$, is described by the equationWork, $W$, is described by the equation


W= d

Some things that we typically consider to be work are not work in the scientific sense of the term. Let's consider a few examples. Think about why each of the following statements is true.Think about why each of the following statements is true.


   Homework is not work.

   Homework is not work.
   Lifting a rock upwards off the ground is work.
   Carrying a rock in a straight path across the lawn at a constant speed is not work.


The first two examples are fairly simple. Homework is not work because objects are not being moved over a distance. Lifting a rock up off the ground is work because the rock is moving in the direction that force is applied. The last example is less obvious. Recall from the laws of motion that force is not required to move an object at constant velocity. Therefore, while some force may be applied to keep the rock up off the ground, no net force is applied to keep the rock moving forward at constant velocity.Therefore, while some force may be applied to keep the rock up off the ground, no net force is applied to keep the rock moving forward at constant velocity.

Work and energy are closely related. When you do work to move an object, you change the object's energy. You (or an object) also expend energy to do work. In fact, energy can be defined as the ability to do work. Energy can take a variety of different forms, and one form of energy can transform to another. In this chapter we will be concerned with mechanical energy, which comes in two forms: kinetic energy and potential energy.In this chapter we will be concerned with mechanical energy, which comes in two forms: kinetic energy and potential energy.


   Kinetic energy is also called energy of motion. A moving object has kinetic energy.
   Potential energy, sometimes called stored energy, comes in several forms. Gravitational potential energy is the stored energy an object has as a result of its position above Earth's surface (or another object in space). A roller coaster car at the top of a hill has gravitational potential energy.
A roller coaster car at the top of a hill has gravitational potential energy.


Let's examine how doing work on an object changes the object's energy. If we apply force to lift a rock off the ground, we increase the rock's potential energy, $P E$. If we drop the rock, the force of gravity increases the rock's kinetic energy as the rock moves downward until it hits the ground.If we drop the rock, the force of gravity increases the rock's kinetic energy as the rock moves downward until it hits the ground.

The force we exert to lift the rock is equal to its weight, $w$, which is equal to its mass, $m$, multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, g.The force we exert to lift the rock is equal to its weight, $w$, which is equal to its mass, $m$, multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, g.

=w=m 


The work we do on the rock equals the force we exert multiplied by the distance, $d$, that we lift the rock. The work we do on the rock also equals the rock's gain in gravitational potential energy, $P E_{e}$.The work we do on the rock also equals the rock's gain in gravitational potential energy, $P E_{e}$.


W=P E_{e}= m 

W=P E_{e}= m 


Kinetic energy depends on the mass of an object and its velocity, $$.Kinetic energy depends on the mass of an object and its velocity, $$.

K E= m 


When we drop the rock the force of gravity causes the rock to fall, giving the rock kinetic energy. When work done on an object increases only its kinetic energy, then the net work equals the change in the value of the quantity $ m $. This is a statement of the work-energy theorem, which is expressed mathematically asThis is a statement of the work-energy theorem, which is expressed mathematically as

The subscripts ${ }_{2}$ and ${ }_{1}$ indicate the final and initial velocity, respectively. This theorem was proposed and successfully tested by James Joule, shown in Figure 9.2.This theorem was proposed and successfully tested by James Joule, shown in Figure 9.2.

Does the name Joule sound familiar? The joule (J) is the metric unit of measurement for both work and energy. The measurement of work and energy with the same unit reinforces the idea that work and energy are related and can be converted into one another. $1.0 =1.0   $, the units of force multiplied by distance. $1.0 =1.0    / $, so $1.0 =1.0    / $. Analyzing the units of the term $(1 / 2) m v^{2}$ will produce the same units for joules.Analyzing the units of the term $(1 / 2) m v^{2}$ will produce the same units for joules.

In applications that involve work, we are often interested in how fast the work is done. For example, in roller coaster design, the amount of time it takes to lift a roller coaster car to the top of the first hill is an important consideration. Taking a half hour on the ascent will surely irritate riders and decrease ticket sales. Let's take a look at how to calculate the time it takes to do work.Let's take a look at how to calculate the time it takes to do work.

Recall that a rate can be used to describe a quantity, such as work, over a period of time. Power is the rate at which work is done. In this case, rate means per unit of time. Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time it took to do the work.Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time it took to do the work.

Let's consider an example that can help illustrate the differences among work, force, and power. Suppose the woman in Figure 9.3 lifting the TV with a pulley gets the TV to the fourth floor in two minutes, and the man carrying the TV up the stairs takes five
minutes to arrive at the same place. They have done the same amount of work $( d)$ on the TV, because they have moved the same mass over the same vertical distance, which requires the same amount of upward force. However, the woman using the pulley has generated more power. This is because she did the work in a shorter amount of time, so the denominator of the power formula, $t$, is smaller. (For simplicity's sake, we will leave aside for now the fact that the man climbing the stairs has also done work on himself.)(For simplicity's sake, we will leave aside for now the fact that the man climbing the stairs has also done work on himself.)

Power can be expressed in units of watts (W). This unit can be used to measure power related to any form of energy or work. You have most likely heard the term used in relation to electrical devices, especially light bulbs. Multiplying power by time gives the amount of energy. Electricity is sold in kilowatt-hours because that equals the amount of electrical energy consumed.Electricity is sold in kilowatt-hours because that equals the amount of electrical energy consumed.

James Watt did not invent the steam engine, but by the time he was finished tinkering with it, it was more useful. The first steam engines were not only inefficient, they only produced a back and forth, or reciprocal, motion. This was natural because pistons move in and out as the pressure in the chamber changes. This limitation was okay for simple tasks like pumping water or mashing potatoes, but did not work so well for moving a train. Watt was able build a steam engine that converted reciprocal motion to circular motion. With that one innovation, the industrial revolution was off and running. The world would never be the same. One of Watt's steam engines is shown in Figure 9.5. The video that follows the figure explains the importance of the steam engine in the industrial revolution.The video that follows the figure explains the importance of the steam engine in the industrial revolution.

Quite a bit of potential energy is gained by a roller coaster car and its passengers when they are raised to the top of the first hill. Remember that the potential part of the term means that energy has been stored and can be used at another time. You will see that this stored energy can either be used to do work or can be transformed into kinetic energy. For example, when an object that has gravitational potential energy falls, its energy is converted to kinetic energy. Remember that both work and energy are expressed in joules.Remember that both work and energy are expressed in joules.

Refer back to . The amount of work required to raise the TV from point A to point B is equal to the amount of gravitational potential energy the TV gains from its height above the ground. This is generally true for any object raised above the ground. If all the work done on an object is used to raise the object above the ground, the amount work equals the object's gain in gravitational potential energy. However, note that because of the work done by friction, these energy-work transformations are never perfect. Friction causes the loss of some useful energy. In the discussions to follow, we will use the approximation that transformations are frictionless.In the discussions to follow, we will use the approximation that transformations are frictionless.

Now, let's look at the roller coaster in Figure 9.6. Work was done on the roller coaster to get it to the top of the first rise; at this point, the roller coaster has gravitational potential energy. It is moving slowly, so it also has a small amount of kinetic energy. As the car descends the first slope, its $P E$ is converted to $K E$. At the low point much of the original $P E$ has been transformed to $K E$, and speed is at a maximum. As the car moves up the next slope, some of the $K E$ is transformed back into $P E$ and the car slows down.As the car moves up the next slope, some of the $K E$ is transformed back into $P E$ and the car slows down.

On an actual roller coaster, there are many ups and downs, and each of these is accompanied by transitions between kinetic and potential energy. Assume that no energy is lost to friction. At any point in the ride, the total mechanical energy is the same, and it is equal to the energy the car had at the top of the first rise. This is a result of the law of conservation of energy, which says that, in a closed system, total energy is conserved-that is, it is constant. Using subscripts 1 and 2 to represent initial and final energy, this law is expressed asUsing subscripts 1 and 2 to represent initial and final energy, this law is expressed as


K E_{1}+P E_{1}=K E_{2}+P E_{2}

K E_{1}+P E_{1}=K E_{2}+P E_{2}


Either side equals the total mechanical energy. The phrase in a closed system means we are assuming no energy is lost to the surroundings due to friction and air resistance. If we are making calculations on dense falling objects, this is a good assumption. For the roller coaster, this assumption introduces some inaccuracy to the calculation.For the roller coaster, this assumption introduces some inaccuracy to the calculation.

Simple machines make work easier, but they do not decrease the amount of work you have to do. Why can't simple machines change the amount of work that you do? Recall that in closed systems the total amount of energy is conserved. A machine cannot increase the amount of energy you put into it. So, why is a simple machine useful? Although it cannot change the amount of work you do, a simple machine can change the amount of force you must apply to an object, and the distance over which you apply the force. In most cases, a simple machine is used to reduce the amount of force you must exert to do work. The down side is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, $f d$, (which equals work) does not change.The down side is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, $f d$, (which equals work) does not change.

Let's examine how this works in practice. In Figure 9.7(a), the worker uses a type of lever to exert a small force over a large distance, while the pry bar pulls up on the nail with a large force over a small distance. Figure 9.7(b) shows the how a lever works mathematically. The effort force, applied at $}$, lifts the load (the resistance force) which is pushing down at $$. The triangular pivot is called the fulcrum; the part of the lever between the fulcrum and $$ is the effort arm, $L_{e}$; and the part to the left is the resistance arm, $L_{r}$. The mechanical advantage is a number that tells us how many times a simple machine multiplies the effort force. The ideal mechanical advantage, IMA, is the mechanical advantage of a perfect machine with no loss of useful work caused by friction between moving parts. The equation for IMA is shown in Figure $9.7(b)$.The equation for IMA is shown in Figure $9.7(b)$.

Getting back to conservation of energy, for any simple machine, the work put into the machine, $W_{i}$, equals the work the machine puts out, $W_{o}$. Combining this with the information in the paragraphs above, we can writeCombining this with the information in the paragraphs above, we can write

Some levers exert a large force to a short effort arm. This results in a smaller force acting over a greater distance at the end of the resistance arm. Examples of this type of lever are baseball bats, hammers, and golf clubs. In another type of lever, the fulcrum is at the end of the lever and the load is in the middle, as in the design of a wheelbarrow.In another type of lever, the fulcrum is at the end of the lever and the load is in the middle, as in the design of a wheelbarrow.

The simple machine shown in Figure 9.8 is called a wheel and axle. It is actually a form of lever. The difference is that the effort arm can rotate in a complete circle around the fulcrum, which is the center of the axle. Force applied to the outside of the wheel causes a greater force to be applied to the rope that is wrapped around the axle. As shown in the figure, the ideal mechanical advantage is calculated by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. Any crank-operated device is an example of a wheel and axle.Any crank-operated device is an example of a wheel and axle.

Figure 9.11 shows three different pulley systems. Of all simple machines, mechanical advantage is easiest to calculate for pulleys. Simply count the number of ropes supporting the load.

INTRODUCTION Have you ever dreamed of traveling to other planets in faraway star systems? The trip might seem possible by traveling fast enough, but you will read in this chapter why it is not. In 1905, Albert Einstein developed the theory of special relativity. Einstein developed the theory to help explain inconsistencies between the equations describing electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics, and to explain why the ether did not exist. This theory explains the limit on an object's speed among other implications.This theory explains the limit on an object's speed among other implications.

Relativity is the study of how different observers moving with respect to one another measure the same events. Galileo and Newton developed the first correct version of classical relativity. Einstein developed the modern theory of relativity. Modern relativity is divided into two parts. Special relativity deals with observers moving at constant velocity. General relativity deals with observers moving at constant acceleration. Einstein's theories of relativity made revolutionary predictions. Most importantly, his predictions have been verified by experiments.Most importantly, his predictions have been verified by experiments.

Relativity is not new. Way back around the year 1600, Galileo explained that motion is relative. Wherever you happen to be, it seems like you are at a fixed point and that everything moves with respect to you. Everyone else feels the same way. Motion is always measured with respect to a fixed point. This is called establishing a frame of reference. But the choice of the point is arbitrary, and all frames of reference are equally valid. A passenger in a moving car is not moving with respect to the driver, but they are both moving from the point of view of a person on the sidewalk waiting for a bus. They are moving even faster as seen by a person in a car coming toward them. It is all relative.It is all relative.


A frame of reference is not a complicated concept. It is just something you decide is a fixed point or group of connected points. It is completely up to you. For example, when you look up at celestial objects in the sky, you choose the earth as your frame of reference, and the sun, moon, etc., seem to move across the sky.For example, when you look up at celestial objects in the sky, you choose the earth as your frame of reference, and the sun, moon, etc., seem to move across the sky.

Light is involved in the discussion of relativity because theories related to electromagnetism are inconsistent with Galileo's and Newton's explanation of relativity. The true nature of light was a hot topic of discussion and controversy in the late 19th century. At the time, it was not generally believed that light could travel across empty space. It was known to travel as waves, and all other types of energy that propagated as waves needed to travel though a material medium. It was believed that space was filled with an invisible medium that light waves traveled through. This imaginary (as it turned out) material was called the ether (also spelled aether). It was thought that everything moved through this mysterious fluid. In other words, ether was the one fixed frame of reference. The Michelson-Morley experiment proved it was not.The Michelson-Morley experiment proved it was not.

In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley designed the interferometer shown in Figure 10.2 to measure the speed of Earth through the ether. A light beam is split into two perpendicular paths and then recombined. Recombining the waves produces an inference pattern, with a bright fringe at the locations where the two waves arrive in phase; that is, with the crests of both waves arriving together and the troughs arriving together. A dark fringe appears where the crest of one wave coincides with a trough of the other, so that the two cancel. If Earth is traveling through the ether as it orbits the sun, the peaks in one arm would take longer than in the other to reach the same location. The places where the two waves arrive in phase would change, and the interference pattern would shift. But, using the interferometer, there was no shift seen! This result led to two conclusions: that there is no ether and that the speed of light is the same regardless of the relative motion of source and observer. The Michelson-Morley investigation has been called the most famous failed experiment in history.The Michelson-Morley investigation has been called the most famous failed experiment in history.

To see what Michelson and Morley expected to find when they measured the speed of light in two directions, watch this animation (). In the video, two people swimming in a lake are represented as an analogy to light beams leaving Earth as it moves through the ether (if there were any ether). The swimmers swim away from and back to a platform that is moving through the water. The swimmers swim in different directions with respect to the motion of the platform. Even though they swim equal distances at the same speed, the motion of the platform causes them to arrive at different times.Even though they swim equal distances at the same speed, the motion of the platform causes them to arrive at different times.


The results described above left physicists with some puzzling and unsettling questions such as, why doesn't light emitted by a fast-moving object travel faster than light from a street lamp? A radical new theory was needed, and Albert Einstein, shown in Figure 10.3, was about to become everyone's favorite genius. Einstein began with two simple postulates based on the two things we have discussed so far in this chapter.Einstein began with two simple postulates based on the two things we have discussed so far in this chapter.

The speed of light is given the symbol $c$ and is equal to exactly $299,792,458  / $. This is the speed of light in vacuum; that is, in the absence of air. For most purposes, we round this number off to $3.00  10^{8}  / $ The term inertial reference frame simply
refers to a frame of reference where all objects follow Newton's first law of motion: Objects at rest remain at rest, and objects in motion remain in motion at a constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. The inside of a car moving along a road at constant velocity and the inside of a stationary house are inertial reference frames.The inside of a car moving along a road at constant velocity and the inside of a stationary house are inertial reference frames.

In this experiment, you will measure the speed of light using a microwave oven and a slice of bread. The waves generated by a microwave oven are not part of the visible spectrum, but they are still electromagnetic radiation, so they travel at the speed of light. If we know the wavelength, $ and frequency, $f$, of a wave, we can calculate its speed, $v$, using the equation $v= f$. You can measure the wavelength. You will find the frequency on a label on the back of a microwave oven. The wave in a microwave is a standing wave with areas of high and low intensity. The high intensity sections are one-half wavelength apart.The high intensity sections are one-half wavelength apart.

Einstein's postulates were carefully chosen, and they both seemed very likely to be true. Einstein proceeded despite realizing that these two ideas taken together and applied to extreme conditions led to results that contradict Newtonian mechanics. He just took the ball and ran with it.He just took the ball and ran with it.

In the traditional view, velocities are additive. If you are running at $3  / $ and you throw a ball forward at a speed of $10  / $, the ball should have a net speed of $13  / $. However, according to relativity theory, the speed of a moving light source is not added to the speed of the emitted light.However, according to relativity theory, the speed of a moving light source is not added to the speed of the emitted light.

In addition, Einstein's theory shows that if you were moving forward relative to Earth at nearly $c$ (the speed of light) and could throw a ball forward at $c$, an observer at rest on the earth would not see the ball moving at nearly twice the speed of light. The observer would see it moving at a speed that is still less than $c$. This result conforms to both of Einstein's postulates: The speed of light has a fixed maximum and neither reference frame is privileged.This result conforms to both of Einstein's postulates: The speed of light has a fixed maximum and neither reference frame is privileged.

Consider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do we know when to start and stop the watch? One method is to use the arrival of light from the event, such as observing a light turn green to start a drag race. The timing will be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications.The timing will be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications.

Now suppose we use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes of light produced by flash lamps on a moving train. (See Figure 10.4)

A woman (observer A) is seated in the center of a rail car, with two flash lamps at opposite sides equidistant from her. Multiple light rays that are emitted from the flash lamps move towards observer A, as shown with arrows. A velocity vector arrow for the rail car is shown towards the right. A man (observer B) standing on the platform is facing the woman and also observes the flashes of light.A man (observer B) standing on the platform is facing the woman and also observes the flashes of light.

Observer A moves with the lamps on the rail car as the rail car moves towards the right of observer B. Observer B receives the light flashes simultaneously, and sees the bulbs as both having flashed at the same time. However, he sees observer A receive the flash from the right first. Because the pulse from the right reaches her first, in her frame of reference she sees the bulbs as not having flashed simultaneously. Here, a relative velocity between observers affects whether two events at well-separated locations are observed to be simultaneous. Simultaneity, or whether different events occur at the same instant, depends on the frame of reference of the observer. Remember that velocity equals distance divided by time, so $t=d / v$. If velocity appears to be different, then duration of time appears to be different.If velocity appears to be different, then duration of time appears to be different.

This illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly that, if light is emitted simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this not to be the case. Einstein was brilliant at this type of thought experiment (in German, Gedankenexperiment). He very carefully considered how an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of thought experiments, of course, is determined by actual observation. The genius of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed his theory of relativity. No experiments after that of Michelson and Morley were able to detect any ether medium. We will describe later how experiments also confirmed other predictions of special relativity, such as the distance between two objects and the time interval of two events being different for two observers moving with respect to each other.lso confirmed other predictions of special relativity, such as the distance between two objects and the time interval of two events being different for two observers moving with respect to each other.

In summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers.Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers.

The discrepancies between Newtonian mechanics and relativity theory illustrate an important point about how science advances. Einstein's theory did not replace Newton's but rather extended it. It is not unusual that a new theory must be developed to account for new information. In most cases, the new theory is built on the foundation of older theory. It is rare that old theories are completely replaced.It is rare that old theories are completely replaced.

Consideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to an important relativistic effect. Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing more slowly for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing more slowly for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.

For example, suppose an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to travel from the light source, cross her ship, bounce off a mirror, and return. (See Figure 10.5.) How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time measured for the same event by a person on the earth? Asking this question (another thought experiment) produces a profound result. We find that the elapsed time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the earth bound observer. The passage of time is different for the two observers because the distance the light travels in the astronaut's frame is smaller than in the earth bound frame. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the earth bound frame.Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the earth bound frame.

Try $225  / $, the speed of an airliner; $2.98  10^{4}  / $, the speed of Earth in its orbit; and $2.990  10^{8}  / $, the speed of a particle in an accelerator.Try $225  / $, the speed of an airliner; $2.98  10^{4}  / $, the speed of Earth in its orbit; and $2.990  10^{8}  / $, the speed of a particle in an accelerator.

Notice that when the velocity $v$ is small compared to the speed of light $c$, then $v / c$ becomes small, and $ becomes close to 1 . When this happens, time measurements are the same in both frames of reference. Relativistic effects, meaning those that have to do with special relativity, usually become significant when speeds become comparable to the speed of light. This is seen to be the case for time dilation.This is seen to be the case for time dilation.

You may have seen science fiction movies in which space travelers return to Earth after a long trip to find that the planet and everyone on it has aged much more than they have. This type of scenario is a based on a thought experiment, known as the twin paradox, which imagines a pair of twins, one of whom goes on a trip into space while the other stays home. When the space traveler returns, she finds her twin has aged much more than she. This happens because the traveling twin has been in two frames of reference, one leaving Earth and one returning.This happens because the traveling twin has been in two frames of reference, one leaving Earth and one returning.

Time dilation has been confirmed by comparing the time recorded by an atomic clock sent into orbit to the time recorded by a clock that remained on Earth. GPS satellites must also be adjusted to compensate for time dilation in order to give accurate positioning.GPS satellites must also be adjusted to compensate for time dilation in order to give accurate positioning.

Have you ever driven on a road, like that shown in Figure 10.6, that seems like it goes on forever? If you look ahead, you might say you have about $10 $ left to go. Another traveler might say the road ahead looks like it is about $15 $ long. If you both measured the road, however, you would agree. Traveling at everyday speeds, the distance you both measure would be the same. You will read in this section, however, that this is not true at relativistic speeds. Close to the speed of light, distances measured are not the same when measured by different observers moving with respect to one other.Close to the speed of light, distances measured are not the same when measured by different observers moving with respect to one other.

One thing all observers agree upon is their relative speed. When one observer is traveling away from another, they both see the other receding at the same speed, regardless of whose frame of reference is chosen. Remember that speed equals distance divided by time: $v=d / t$. If the observers experience a difference in elapsed time, they must also observe a difference in distance traversed. This is because the ratio $d / t$ must be the same for both observers.This is because the ratio $d / t$ must be the same for both observers.

The shortening of distance experienced by an observer moving with respect to the points whose distance apart is measured is called length contraction. Proper length, $L_{ is the distance between two points measured in the reference frame where the observer and the points are at rest. The observer in motion with respect to the points measures $L$. These two lengths are related by the equationThese two lengths are related by the equation

In classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and velocity. When special relativity is taken into account, objects that have mass have a speed limit. What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at relativistic speeds; i.e., speeds close to the speed of light?What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at relativistic speeds; i.e., speeds close to the speed of light?

Momentum is one of the most important concepts in physics. The broadest form of Newton's second law is stated in terms of momentum. Momentum is conserved in classical mechanics whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions. We will see that momentum has the same importance in modern physics. Relativistic momentum is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles.Relativistic momentum is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles.

One of the postulates of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? The answer is yes, provided that the momentum is defined as follows.Does the law of conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities?

where $m$ is the rest mass of the object (that is, the mass measured at rest, without any $ factor involved), $$ is its velocity relative to an observer, and $ as before, is the relativistic factor. We use the mass of the object as measured at rest because we cannot determine its mass while it is moving.We use the mass of the object as measured at rest because we cannot determine its mass while it is moving.

Note that we use $$ for velocity here to distinguish it from relative velocity $$ between observers. Only one observer is being considered here. With $$ defined in this way, $}$ is conserved whenever the net external force is zero, just as in classical physics. Again we see that the relativistic quantity becomes virtually the same as the classical at low velocities. That is, relativistic momentum $ m $ becomes the classical $m $ at low velocities, because $ is very nearly equal to 1 at low velocities.That is, relativistic momentum $ m $ becomes the classical $m $ at low velocities, because $ is very nearly equal to 1 at low velocities.

Relativistic momentum has the same intuitive feel as classical momentum. It is greatest for large masses moving at high velocities. Because of the factor $ however, relativistic momentum behaves differently from classical momentum by approaching infinity as $$ approaches $c$. (See Figure 10.7.) This is another indication that an object with mass cannot reach the speed of light. If it did, its momentum would become infinite, which is an unreasonable value.If it did, its momentum would become infinite, which is an unreasonable value.

The original source of all the energy we use is the conversion of mass into energy. Most of this energy is generated by nuclear reactions in the sun and radiated to Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation, where it is then transformed into all the forms with which we are familiar. The remaining energy from nuclear reactions is produced in nuclear power plants and in Earth's interior. In each of these cases, the source of the energy is the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount of energy. These sources are shown in Figure 10.8.These sources are shown in Figure 10.8.

The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that the law of conservation of energy is valid relativistically, if we define energy to include a relativistic factor. The result of his analysis is that a particle or object of mass $m$ moving at velocity $$ has relativistic energy given byThe result of his analysis is that a particle or object of mass $m$ moving at velocity $$ has relativistic energy given by

This equation is very useful to nuclear physicists because it can be used to calculate the energy released by a nuclear reaction. This is done simply by subtracting the mass of the products of such a reaction from the mass of the reactants. The difference is the $m$ in $E_{0}=m c^{2}$. Here is a simple example:Here is a simple example:

A positron is a type of antimatter that is just like an electron, except that it has a positive charge. When a positron and an electron collide, their masses are completely annihilated and converted to energy in the form of gamma rays. Because both particles have a rest mass of $9.11  10^{-31} $, we multiply the $m c^{2}$ term by 2 . So the energy of the gamma rays isSo the energy of the gamma rays is

where we have the expression for the joule (J) in terms of its SI base units of $, $, and s. In general, the nuclei of stable isotopes have less mass then their constituent subatomic particles. The energy equivalent of this difference is called the binding energy of the nucleus. This energy is released during the formation of the isotope from its constituent particles because the product is more stable than the reactants. Expressed as mass, it is called the mass defect. For example, a helium nucleus is made of two neutrons and two protons and has a mass of 4.0003 atomic mass units $()$. The sum of the masses of two protons and two neutrons is $4.0330 $. The mass defect then is $0.0327 $. Converted to $$, the mass defect is $5.0442  10^{-30} $. Multiplying this mass times $c^{2}$ gives a binding energy of $4.540  10^{-12} $. This does not sound like much because it is only one atom. If you were to make one gram of helium out of neutrons and protons, it would release $683,000,000,000 $. By comparison, burning one gram of coal releases about $24 $.By comparison, burning one gram of coal releases about $24 $.

But what is the point of creating such an extreme event? Under these conditions, the neutrons and protons that make up the gold nuclei are smashed apart into their components, which are called quarks and gluons. The goal is to recreate the conditions that theorists believe existed at the very beginning of the universe. It is thought that, at that time, matter was a sort of soup of quarks and gluons. When things cooled down after the initial bang, these particles condensed to form protons and neutrons.When things cooled down after the initial bang, these particles condensed to form protons and neutrons.

Some of the results have been surprising and unexpected. It was thought the quark-gluon soup would resemble a gas or plasma. Instead, it behaves more like a liquid.

11.2 Heat, Specific Heat, and Heat Transfer


INTRODUCTION Heat is something familiar to all of us. We feel the warmth of the summer sun, the hot vapor rising up out of a cup of hot cocoa, and the cooling effect of our sweat. When we feel warmth, it means that heat is transferring energy to our bodies; when we feel cold, that means heat is transferring energy away from our bodies. Heat transfer is the movement of thermal energy from one place or material to another, and is caused by temperature differences. For example, much of our weather is caused by Earth evening out the temperature across the planet through wind and violent storms, which are driven by heat transferring energy away from the equator towards the cold poles. In this chapter, we'll explore the precise meaning of heat, how it relates to temperature as well as to other forms of energy, and its connection to work.In this chapter, we'll explore the precise meaning of heat, how it relates to temperature as well as to other forms of energy, and its connection to work.

What is temperature? It's one of those concepts so ingrained in our everyday lives that, although we know what it means intuitively, it can be hard to define. It is tempting to say that temperature measures heat, but this is not strictly true. Heat is the transfer of energy due to a temperature difference. Temperature is defined in terms of the instrument we use to tell us how hot or cold an object is, based on a mechanism and scale invented by people. Temperature is literally defined as what we measure on a thermometer.Temperature is literally defined as what we measure on a thermometer.

Heat is often confused with temperature. For example, we may say that the heat was unbearable, when we actually mean that the temperature was high. This is because we are sensitive to the flow of energy by heat, rather than the temperature. Since heat, like work, transfers energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J).Since heat, like work, transfers energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J).

Atoms and molecules are constantly in motion, bouncing off one another in random directions. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and that it increases in proportion to velocity squared. Without going into mathematical detail, we can say that thermal energy - the energy associated with heat-is the average kinetic energy of the particles (molecules or atoms) in a substance. Faster moving molecules have greater kinetic energies, and so the substance has greater thermal energy, and thus a higher temperature. The total internal energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its atoms and molecules. Thermal energy is one of the subcategories of internal energy, as is chemical energy.Thermal energy is one of the subcategories of internal energy, as is chemical energy.

To measure temperature, some scale must be used as a standard of measurement. The three most commonly used temperature scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales. Both the Fahrenheit scale and Celsius scale are relative temperature scales, meaning that they are made around a reference point. For example, the Celsius scale uses the freezing point of water as its reference point; all measurements are either lower than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a negative sign), or higher than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a positive sign). The boiling point of water is $100{ }^{ $ for the Celsius scale, and its unit is the degree Celsius $^{ The boiling point of water is $100{ }^{ $ for the Celsius scale, and its unit is the degree Celsius $^{ 

On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is at $32{ }^{ $, and the boiling point is at $212{ }^{ $. The unit of temperature on this scale is the degree Fahrenheit $^{  Note that the difference in degrees between the freezing and boiling points is greater for the Fahrenheit scale than for the Celsius scale. Therefore, a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a temperature difference of one degree Fahrenheit. Since 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees, one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale (because $=1.8$ ). This relationship can be used to convert between temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius (see Figure 11.2).This relationship can be used to convert between temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius (see Figure 11.2).

The Kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science because it is an absolute temperature scale. This means that the theoretically lowest-possible temperature is assigned the value of zero. Zero degrees on the Kelvin scale is known as absolute zero; it is theoretically the point at which there is no molecular motion to produce thermal energy. On the original Kelvin scale first created by Lord Kelvin, all temperatures have positive values, making it useful for scientific work. The official temperature unit on this scale is the kelvin, which is abbreviated as $$. The freezing point of water is $273.15 $, and the boiling point of water is $373.15 $.The freezing point of water is $273.15 $, and the boiling point of water is $373.15 $.

Although absolute zero is possible in theory, it cannot be reached in practice. The lowest temperature ever created and measured during a laboratory experiment was $1.0  10^{-10} $, at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. In comparison, the coldest recorded temperature for a place on Earth's surface was $183   at Vostok, Antarctica, and the coldest known place (outside the lab) in the universe is the Boomerang Nebula, with a temperature of $1 $. Luckily, most of us humans will never have to experience such extremes.Luckily, most of us humans will never have to experience such extremes.

Even without the number labels on the thermometer, you could tell which side is marked Fahrenheit and which is Celsius by how the degree marks are spaced. Why?Why?

While the Fahrenheit scale is still the most commonly used scale in the United States, the majority of the world uses Celsius, and scientists prefer Kelvin. It's often necessary to convert between these scales. For instance, if the TV meteorologist gave the local weather report in kelvins, there would likely be some confused viewers! Table 11.1 gives the equations for conversion between the three temperature scales.ance, if the TV meteorologist gave the local weather report in kelvins, there would likely be some confused viewers!

Sometimes it is not so easy to guess the temperature of the air accurately. Why is this? Factors such as humidity and wind speed affect how hot or cold we feel. Wind removes thermal energy from our bodies at a faster rate than usual, making us feel colder than we otherwise would; on a cold day, you may have heard the TV weather person refer to the wind chill. On humid summer days, people tend to feel hotter because sweat doesn't evaporate from the skin as efficiently as it does on dry days, when the evaporation of sweat cools us off.On humid summer days, people tend to feel hotter because sweat doesn't evaporate from the skin as efficiently as it does on dry days, when the evaporation of sweat cools us off.

We learned in the previous section that temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a substance, and that the average internal kinetic energy of a substance is higher when the substance's temperature is higher.e is proportional to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a substance, and that the average internal kinetic energy of a substance is higher when the substance's temperature is higher.

If two objects at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter object (that is, the object with the greater temperature) to the colder (lower temperature) object, until both objects are at the same temperature. There is no net heat transfer once the temperatures are equal because the amount of heat transferred from one object to the other is the same as the amount of heat returned. One of the major effects of heat transfer is temperature change: Heating increases the temperature while cooling decreases it. Experiments show that the heat transferred to or from a substance depends on three factors-the change in the substance's temperature, the mass of the substance, and certain physical properties related to the phase of the substance.transferred to or from a substance depends on three factors-the change in the substance's temperature, the mass of the substance, and certain physical properties related to the phase of the substance.

where $m$ is the mass of the substance and $ T$ is the change in its temperature, in units of Celsius or Kelvin. The symbol $c$ stands for specific heat, and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of $1.00 $ of mass by $1.00{ }^{ $. The specific heat $c$ is a property of the substance; its SI unit is $J /(  )$ or $ / ^{  The temperature change $( T)$ is the same in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius (but not degrees Fahrenheit). Specific heat is closely related to the concept of heat capacity. Heat capacity is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of a substance by $1.00^{ $. In equation form, heat capacity $C$ is $C=m c$, where $m$ is mass and $c$ is specific heat. Note that heat capacity is the same as specific heat, but without any dependence on mass. Consequently, two objects made up of the same material but with different masses will have different heat capacities. This is because the heat capacity is a property of an object, but specific heat is a property of any object made of the same material.This is because the heat capacity is a property of an object, but specific heat is a property of any object made of the same material.

Values of specific heat must be looked up in tables, because there is no simple way to calculate them. Table 11.2 gives the values of specific heat for a few substances as a handy reference. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of $1 $ of water than to raise the temperature of $1 $ of glass by the same number of degrees.r is five times that of glass, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of $1 $ of water than to raise the temperature of $1 $ of glass by the same number of degrees.

Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may happen rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of an insulated cooler.Heat transfer may happen rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of an insulated cooler.

There are three different heat transfer methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. At times, all three may happen simultaneously. See Figure 11.3.See Figure 11.3.

Figure 11.3 In a fireplace, heat transfer occurs by all three methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation is responsible for most of the heat transferred into the room. Heat transfer also occurs through conduction into the room, but at a much slower rate. Heat transfer by convection also occurs through cold air entering the room around windows and hot air leaving the room by rising up the chimney.Heat transfer by convection also occurs through cold air entering the room around windows and hot air leaving the room by rising up the chimney.

Conduction is heat transfer through direct physical contact. Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Sometimes, we try to control the conduction of heat to make ourselves more comfortable. Since the rate of heat transfer is different for different materials, we choose fabrics, such as a thick wool sweater, that slow down the transfer of heat away from our bodies in winter.Since the rate of heat transfer is different for different materials, we choose fabrics, such as a thick wool sweater, that slow down the transfer of heat away from our bodies in winter.

As you walk barefoot across the living room carpet, your feet feel relatively comfortable...until you step onto the kitchen's tile floor. Since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature, why does one feel colder than the other? This is explained by different rates of heat transfer: The tile material removes heat from your skin at a greater rate than the carpeting, which makes it feel colder.s one feel colder than the other?

Some materials simply conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, metals (like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are good heat conductors, whereas materials like wood, plastic, and rubber are poor heat conductors.In general, metals (like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are good heat conductors, whereas materials like wood, plastic, and rubber are poor heat conductors.

Figure 11.4 shows particles (either atoms or molecules) in two bodies at different temperatures. The (average) kinetic energy of a particle in the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two particles collide, energy transfers from the particle with greater kinetic energy to the particle with less kinetic energy. When two bodies are in contact, many particle collisions occur, resulting in a net flux of heat from the higher-temperature body to the lower-temperature body. The heat flux depends on the temperature difference $ T=T_{ {hot }}-T_{ {cold }}$. Therefore, you will get a more severe burn from boiling water than from hot tap water.Therefore, you will get a more severe burn from boiling water than from hot tap water.

Figure 11.4 The particles in two bodies at different temperatures have different average kinetic energies. Collisions occurring at the contact surface tend to transfer energy from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions. In this illustration, a particle in the lowertemperature region (right side) has low kinetic energy before collision, but its kinetic energy increases after colliding with the contact
surface. In contrast, a particle in the higher-temperature region (left side) has more kinetic energy before collision, but its energy decreases after colliding with the contact surface.In contrast, a particle in the higher-temperature region (left side) has more kinetic energy before collision, but its energy decreases after colliding with the contact surface.

Convection is heat transfer by the movement of a fluid. This type of heat transfer happens, for example, in a pot boiling on the stove, or in thunderstorms, where hot air rises up to the base of the clouds.This type of heat transfer happens, for example, in a pot boiling on the stove, or in thunderstorms, where hot air rises up to the base of the clouds.


In everyday language, the term fluid is usually taken to mean liquid. For example, when you are sick and the doctor tells you to "push fluids," that only means to drink more beverages-not to breath more air. However, in physics, fluid means a liquid or a gas. Fluids move differently than solid material, and even have their own branch of physics, known as fluid dynamics, that studies how they move.Fluids move differently than solid material, and even have their own branch of physics, known as fluid dynamics, that studies how they move.

As the temperature of fluids increase, they expand and become less dense. For example, Figure 11.4 could represent the wall of a balloon with different temperature gases inside the balloon than outside in the environment. The hotter and thus faster moving gas particles inside the balloon strike the surface with more force than the cooler air outside, causing the balloon to expand. This decrease in density relative to its environment creates buoyancy (the tendency to rise). Convection is driven by buoyancy-hot air rises because it is less dense than the surrounding air.Convection is driven by buoyancy-hot air rises because it is less dense than the surrounding air.

Sometimes, we control the temperature of our homes or ourselves by controlling air movement. Sealing leaks around doors with weather stripping keeps out the cold wind in winter. The house in Figure 11.5 and the pot of water on the stove in Figure 11.6 are both examples of convection and buoyancy by human design. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation transfer energy from one part of the globe to another, and are examples of natural convection.Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation transfer energy from one part of the globe to another, and are examples of natural convection.

Figure 11.5 Air heated by the so-called gravity furnace expands and rises, forming a convective loop that transfers energy to other parts of the room. As the air is cooled at the ceiling and outside walls, it contracts, eventually becoming denser than room air and sinking to the floor. A properly designed heating system like this one, which uses natural convection, can be quite efficient in uniformly heating a home.A properly designed heating system like this one, which uses natural convection, can be quite efficient in uniformly heating a home.

Figure 11.6 Convection plays an important role in heat transfer inside this pot of water. Once conducted to the inside fluid, heat transfer to other parts of the pot is mostly by convection. The hotter water expands, decreases in density, and rises to transfer heat to other regions of the water, while colder water sinks to the bottom. This process repeats as long as there is water in the pot.This process repeats as long as there is water in the pot.

Radiation is a form of heat transfer that occurs when electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. Electromagnetic
radiation includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays, all of which have different wavelengths and amounts of energy (shorter wavelengths have higher frequency and more energy).ared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays, all of which have different wavelengths and amounts of energy (shorter wavelengths have higher frequency and more energy).

You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the sun. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking inside-it may just warm you as you walk by. Another example is thermal radiation from the human body; people are constantly emitting infrared radiation, which is not visible to the human eye, but is felt as heat.Another example is thermal radiation from the human body; people are constantly emitting infrared radiation, which is not visible to the human eye, but is felt as heat.

Radiation is the only method of heat transfer where no medium is required, meaning that the heat doesn't need to come into direct contact with or be transported by any matter. The space between Earth and the sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. Instead, heat is transferred by radiation, and Earth is warmed as it absorbs electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun.Instead, heat is transferred by radiation, and Earth is warmed as it absorbs electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun.

Figure 11.7 Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation. The visible light transfers relatively little thermal energy. Since skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (Daniel X. O’Neil)O’Neil)

All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation (see Figure 11.7). The rate of heat transfer by radiation depends mainly on the color of the object. Black is the most effective absorber and radiator, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance. Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be hotter than adjacent patches of grass on a summer day, because black absorbs better than green. The reverse is also true-black radiates better than green. On a clear summer night, the black asphalt will be colder than the green patch of grass, because black radiates energy faster than green. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and also a poor radiator. A white object reflects nearly all radiation, like a mirror.A white object reflects nearly all radiation, like a mirror.

In this example, most of the total heat transferred is used to heat the water, even though the pan has twice as much mass. This is
because the specific heat of water is over four times greater than the specific heat of aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more than twice as much heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water than for the aluminum pan.Therefore, it takes a bit more than twice as much heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water than for the aluminum pan.

Water can absorb a tremendous amount of energy with very little resulting temperature change. This property of water allows for life on Earth because it stabilizes temperatures. Other planets are less habitable because wild temperature swings make for a harsh environment. You may have noticed that climates closer to large bodies of water, such as oceans, are milder than climates landlocked in the middle of a large continent. This is due to the climate-moderating effect of water's large heat capacity-water stores large amounts of heat during hot weather and releases heat gradually when it's cold outside.This is due to the climate-moderating effect of water's large heat capacity-water stores large amounts of heat during hot weather and releases heat gradually when it's cold outside.



When a truck headed downhill brakes, the brakes must do work to convert the gravitational potential energy of the truck to internal energy of the brakes. This conversion prevents the gravitational potential energy from being converted into kinetic energy of the truck, and keeps the truck from speeding up and losing control. The increased internal energy of the brakes raises their temperature. When the hill is especially steep, the temperature increase may happen too quickly and cause the brakes to overheat.When the hill is especially steep, the temperature increase may happen too quickly and cause the brakes to overheat.

This temperature is close to the boiling point of water. If the truck had been traveling for some time, then just before the descent, the brake temperature would likely be higher than the ambient temperature. The temperature increase in the descent would likely raise the temperature of the brake material above the boiling point of water, which would be hard on the brakes. This is why truck drivers sometimes use a different technique for called "engine braking" to avoid burning their brakes during steep descents.

So far, we have learned that adding thermal energy by heat increases the temperature of a substance. But surprisingly, there are situations where adding energy does not change the temperature of a substance at all! Instead, the additional thermal energy acts to loosen bonds between molecules or atoms and causes a phase change. Because this energy enters or leaves a system during a phase change without causing a temperature change in the system, it is known as latent heat (latent means hidden).Because this energy enters or leaves a system during a phase change without causing a temperature change in the system, it is known as latent heat (latent means hidden).

The three phases of matter that you frequently encounter are solid, liquid and gas (see Figure 11.8). Solid has the least energetic state; atoms in solids are in close contact, with forces between them that allow the particles to vibrate but not change position with neighboring particles.

Although you may not have heard much about plasma, it is actually the most common state of matter in the universe-stars are made up of plasma, as is lightning. The plasma state is reached by heating a gas to the point where particles are pulled apart, separating the electrons from the rest of the particle. This produces an ionized gas that is a combination of the negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions, known as plasma.This produces an ionized gas that is a combination of the negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions, known as plasma.

A rock is an example of a solid. This rock retains its shape because of the forces holding its atoms or molecules together. (b) Particles in a liquid are also in close contact but can slide over one another. Forces between them strongly resist attempts to push them closer together and also hold them in close contact. Water is an example of a liquid. Water can flow, but it also remains in an open container because of the forces between its molecules.

Energy is required to melt a solid because the bonds between the particles in the solid must be broken. Since the energy involved in a phase changes is used to break bonds, there is no increase in the kinetic energies of the particles, and therefore no rise in temperature. Similarly, energy is needed to vaporize a liquid to overcome the attractive forces between particles in the liquid. There is no temperature change until a phase change is completed. The temperature of a cup of soda and ice that is initially at 0 ${ }^{ $ stays at $0^{ $ until all of the ice has melted. In the reverse of these processes-freezing and condensation—energy is released
from the latent heat (see Figure 11.9).In the reverse of these processes-freezing and condensation—energy is released

Let's consider the example of adding heat to ice to examine its transitions through all three phases-solid to liquid to gas. A phase diagram indicating the temperature changes of water as energy is added is shown in Figure 11.10. The ice starts out at -20 ${ }^{ $, and its temperature rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate until it reaches $0^{ Once at this temperature, the ice gradually melts, absorbing $334  / $. The temperature remains constant at $0^{ $ during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted, the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate. At $100{ }^{ $, the water begins to boil and the temperature again remains constant while the water absorbs $2256  / $ during this phase change. When all the liquid has become steam, the temperature rises again at a constant rate.When all the liquid has become steam, the temperature rises again at a constant rate.

Figure 11.10 A graph of temperature versus added energy. The system is constructed so that no vapor forms while ice warms to become liquid water, and so when vaporization occurs, the vapor remains in the system. The long stretches of constant temperature values at $0{ }^{ $ and $100{ }^{ $ reflect the large latent heats of melting and vaporization, respectively.The long stretches of constant temperature values at $0{ }^{ $ and $100{ }^{ $ reflect the large latent heats of melting and vaporization, respectively.

We have seen that vaporization requires heat transfer to a substance from its surroundings. Condensation is the reverse process, where heat in transferred away from a substance to its surroundings. This release of latent heat increases the temperature of the surroundings. Energy must be removed from the condensing particles to make a vapor condense. This is why condensation occurs on cold surfaces: the heat transfers energy away from the warm vapor to the cold surface. The energy is exactly the same as that required to cause the phase change in the other direction, from liquid to vapor, and so it can be calculated from $Q=m L_{v}$. Latent heat is also released into the environment when a liquid freezes, and can be calculated from $Q=m L_{f}$.Latent heat is also released into the environment when a liquid freezes, and can be calculated from $Q=m L_{f}$.

Ice cream is certainly easy enough to buy at the supermarket, but for the hardcore ice cream enthusiast, that may not be satisfying enough. Going through the process of making your own ice cream lets you invent your own flavors and marvel at the physics firsthand (Figure 11.11).Going through the process of making your own ice cream lets you invent your own flavors and marvel at the physics firsthand (Figure 11.11).

The first step to making homemade ice cream is to mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, and your flavor of choice; it could be as
simple as cocoa powder or vanilla extract, or as fancy as pomegranates or pistachios.p to making homemade ice cream is to mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, and your flavor of choice; it could be as

The next step is to pour the mixture into a container that is deep enough that you will be able to churn the mixture without it spilling over, and that is also freezer-safe. After placing it in the freezer, the ice cream has to be stirred vigorously every 45 minutes for four to five hours. This slows the freezing process and prevents the ice cream from turning into a solid block of ice. Most people prefer a soft creamy texture instead of one giant popsicle.Most people prefer a soft creamy texture instead of one giant popsicle.

As it freezes, the cream undergoes a phase change from liquid to solid. By now, we're experienced enough to know that this means that the cream must experience a loss of heat. Where does that heat go? Due to the temperature difference between the freezer and the ice cream mixture, heat transfers thermal energy from the ice cream to the air in the freezer. Once the temperature in the freezer rises enough, the freezer is cooled by pumping excess heat outside into the kitchen.Once the temperature in the freezer rises enough, the freezer is cooled by pumping excess heat outside into the kitchen.

A faster way to make ice cream is to chill it by placing the mixture in a plastic bag, surrounded by another plastic bag half full of ice. (You can also add a teaspoon of salt to the outer bag to lower the temperature of the ice/salt mixture.) Shaking the bag for five minutes churns the ice cream while cooling it evenly. In this case, the heat transfers energy out of the ice cream mixture and into the ice during the phase change.In this case, the heat transfers energy out of the ice cream mixture and into the ice during the phase change.

The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of $0^{ $. Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting. Melting of ice occurs in two steps: first, the phase change occurs and solid (ice) transforms into liquid water at the melting temperature; then, the temperature of this water rises. Melting yields water at $0^{ $, so more heat is transferred from the soda to this water until they are the same temperature. Since the amount of heat leaving the soda is the same as the amount of heat transferred to the ice.Since the amount of heat leaving the soda is the same as the amount of heat transferred to the ice.

The heat transferred to the ice goes partly toward the phase change (melting), and partly toward raising the temperature after melting.

INTRODUCTION Energy can be transferred to or from a system, either through a temperature difference between it and another system (i.e., by heat) or by exerting a force through a distance (work). In these ways, energy can be converted into other forms of energy in other systems. For example, a car engine burns fuel for heat transfer into a gas. Work is done by the gas as it exerts a force through a distance by pushing a piston outward. This work converts the energy into a variety of other forms-into an increase in the car's kinetic or gravitational potential energy; into electrical energy to run the spark plugs, radio, and lights; and back into stored energy in the car's battery. But most of the thermal energy transferred by heat from the fuel burning in the engine does not do work on the gas. Instead, much of this energy is released into the surroundings at lower temperature (i.e., lost through heat), which is quite inefficient. Car engines are only about 25 to 30 percent efficient. This inefficiency leads to increased fuel costs, so there is great interest in improving fuel efficiency. However, it is common knowledge that modern gasoline engines cannot be made much more efficient. The same is true about the conversion to electrical energy in large power stations, whether they are coal, oil, natural gas, or nuclear powered. Why is this the case?Why is this the case?

The answer lies in the nature of heat. Basic physical laws govern how heat transfer for doing work takes place and limit the
maximum possible efficiency of the process. This chapter will explore these laws as well their applications to everyday machines. These topics are part of thermodynamics-the study of heat and its relationship to doing work.These topics are part of thermodynamics-the study of heat and its relationship to doing work.

We learned in the previous chapter that when two objects (or systems) are in contact with one another, heat will transfer thermal energy from the object at higher temperature to the one at lower temperature until they both reach the same temperature. The objects are then in thermal equilibrium, and no further temperature changes will occur if they are isolated from other systems. The systems interact and change because their temperatures are different, and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same. Thermal equilibrium is established when two bodies are in thermal contact with each other-meaning heat transfer (i.e., the transfer of energy by heat) can occur between them. If two systems cannot freely exchange energy, they will not reach thermal equilibrium. (It is fortunate that empty space stands between Earth and the sun, because a state of thermal equilibrium with the sun would be too toasty for life on this planet!)(It is fortunate that empty space stands between Earth and the sun, because a state of thermal equilibrium with the sun would be too toasty for life on this planet!)

If two systems, $A$ and $B$, are in thermal equilibrium with each another, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then $A$ is also in thermal equilibrium with $C$. This statement may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic to thermodynamics. It is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.It is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.


The zeroth law of thermodynamics is very similar to the transitive property of equality in mathematics: If $a=b$ and $b=$ $$, then $$.

You may be wondering at this point, why the wacky name? Shouldn't this be called the first law of thermodynamics rather than the zeroth? The explanation is that this law was discovered after the first and second laws of thermodynamics but is so fundamental that scientists decided it should logically come first. rather than the zeroth?

As an example of the zeroth law in action, consider newborn babies in neonatal intensive-care units in hospitals. Prematurely born or sick newborns are placed in special incubators. These babies have very little covering while in the incubators, so to an observer, they look as though they may not be warm enough. However, inside the incubator, the temperature of the air, the cot, and the baby are all the same-that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. The ambient temperature is just high enough to keep the baby safe and comfortable.The ambient temperature is just high enough to keep the baby safe and comfortable.



Thermodynamics engineers apply the principles of thermodynamics to mechanical systems so as to create or test products that rely on the interactions between heat, work, pressure, temperature, and volume. This type of work typically takes place in the aerospace industry, chemical manufacturing companies, industrial manufacturing plants, power plants (Figure 12.2), engine manufacturers, or electronics companies. of work typically takes place in the aerospace industry, chemical manufacturing companies, industrial manufacturing plants, power plants (Figure 12.2), engine manufacturers, or electronics companies.

The need for energy creates quite a bit of demand for thermodynamics engineers, because both traditional energy companies and alternative (green) energy startups rely on interactions between heat and work and so require the expertise of thermodynamics engineers. Traditional energy companies use mainly nuclear energy and energy from burning fossil fuels, such as coal. Alternative energy is finding new ways to harness renewable and, often, more readily available energy sources, such as solar, water, wind, and bio-energy.Alternative energy is finding new ways to harness renewable and, often, more readily available energy sources, such as solar, water, wind, and bio-energy.

A thermodynamics engineer in the energy industry can find the most efficient way to turn the burning of a biofuel or fossil fuel into energy, store that energy for times when it's needed most, or figure out how to best deliver that energy from where it's produced to where it's used: in homes, factories, and businesses. Additionally, he or she might also design pollution-control equipment to remove harmful pollutants from the smoke produced as a by-product of burning fuel. For example, a thermodynamics engineer may develop a way to remove mercury from burning coal in a coal-fired power plant.For example, a thermodynamics engineer may develop a way to remove mercury from burning coal in a coal-fired power plant.

Thermodynamics engineering is an expanding field, where employment opportunities are expected to grow by as much as 27 percent between 2012 and 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. To become a thermodynamics engineer, you must have a college degree in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering, aerospace engineering, civil engineering, or biological engineering (depending on which type of career you wish to pursue), with coursework in physics and physical chemistry that focuses on thermodynamics.pace engineering, civil engineering, or biological engineering (depending on which type of career you wish to pursue), with coursework in physics and physical chemistry that focuses on thermodynamics.

Pressure is defined for all states of matter but is particularly important when discussing fluids (such as air). You have probably heard the word pressure being used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in relation to the weather (high- and low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids.These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids.

The relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for an ideal gas is given by the ideal gas law. A gas is considered ideal at low pressure and fairly high temperature, and forces between its component particles can be ignored. The ideal gas law states thatThe ideal gas law states that

where $P$ is the pressure of a gas, $V$ is the volume it occupies, $N$ is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in the gas, and $T$ is
its absolute temperature. The constant $k$ is called the Boltzmann constant and has the value $k=1.38  10^{-23}  / $, For the purposes of this chapter, we will not go into calculations using the ideal gas law. Instead, it is important for us to notice from the equation that the following are true for a given mass of gas:Instead, it is important for us to notice from the equation that the following are true for a given mass of gas:


   When volume is constant, pressure is directly proportional to temperature.

This last point describes thermal expansion-the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? An increase in temperature means that there's an increase in the kinetic energy of the individual atoms. Gases are especially affected by thermal expansion, although liquids expand to a lesser extent with similar increases in temperature, and even solids have minor expansions at higher temperatures. This is why railroad tracks and bridges have expansion joints that allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.This is why railroad tracks and bridges have expansion joints that allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.

To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what happens when you pump air into a deflated tire. The tire's volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If you continue to pump air into tire (which now has a nearly constant volume), the pressure increases with increasing temperature (see Figure 12.4).If you continue to pump air into tire (which now has a nearly constant volume), the pressure increases with increasing temperature (see Figure 12.4).

Pressure-volume work is the work that is done by the compression or expansion of a fluid. Whenever there is a change in volume and external pressure remains constant, pressure-volume work is taking place. During a compression, a decrease in volume increases the internal pressure of a system as work is done on the system. During an expansion (Figure 12.5), an increase in volume decreases the internal pressure of a system as the system does work.During an expansion (Figure 12.5), an increase in volume decreases the internal pressure of a system as the system does work.

Just as we say that work is force acting over a distance, for fluids, we can say that work is the pressure acting through the change in volume. For pressure-volume work, pressure is analogous to force, and volume is analogous to distance in the traditional definition of work.For pressure-volume work, pressure is analogous to force, and volume is analogous to distance in the traditional definition of work.

Heat $(Q)$ and work $(W)$ are the two ways to add or remove energy from a system. The processes are very different. Heat is driven
by temperature differences, while work involves a force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and work can produce identical results. For example, both can cause a temperature increase. Heat transfers energy into a system, such as when the sun warms the air in a bicycle tire and increases the air's temperature. Similarly, work can be done on the system, as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat or work. Heat and work are both energy in transit-neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can change the internal energy, $U$, of a system.However, both can change the internal energy, $U$, of a system.

Internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system's atoms and molecules. It can be divided into many subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy, and depends only on the state of a system (that is, $P, V$, and $T$ ), not on how the energy enters or leaves the system.t can be divided into many subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy, and depends only on the state of a system (that is, $P, V$, and $T$ ), not on how the energy enters or leaves the system.

In order to understand the relationship between heat, work, and internal energy, we use the first law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat and work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the systems. It can also be used to describe how energy transferred by heat is converted and transferred again by work.It can also be used to describe how energy transferred by heat is converted and transferred again by work.

Here, $ U$ is the change in internal energy, $U$, of the system. As shown in Figure 12.6, $Q$ is the net heat transferred into the system-that is, $Q$ is the sum of all heat transfers into and out of the system. $W$ is the net work done by the system -that is, $W$ is the sum of all work done on or by the system. By convention, if $Q$ is positive, then there is a net heat transfer into the system; if $W$ is positive, then there is net work done by the system. So positive $Q$ adds energy to the system by heat, and positive $W$ takes energy from the system by work. Note that if heat transfers more energy into the system than that which is done by work, the difference is stored as internal energy.Note that if heat transfers more energy into the system than that which is done by work, the difference is stored as internal energy.

Life itself depends on the biological transfer of energy. Through photosynthesis, plants absorb solar energy from the sun and use this energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes in one form of energy — light—and converts it into another form—chemical potential energy (glucose and other carbohydrates).Photosynthesis takes in one form of energy — light—and converts it into another form—chemical potential energy (glucose and other carbohydrates).

The body metabolizes all the food we consume. Basically, metabolism is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential energy of food is released. This implies that food input is in the form of work. Exercise helps you lose weight, because it provides energy transfer from your body by both heat and work and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest.Exercise helps you lose weight, because it provides energy transfer from your body by both heat and work and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest.

Biological thermodynamics also involves the study of transductions between cells and living organisms. Transduction is a process where genetic material-DNA-is transferred from one cell to another. This often occurs during a viral infection (e.g., influenza) and is how the virus spreads, namely, by transferring its genetic material to an increasing number of previously healthy cells. Once enough cells become infected, you begin to feel the effects of the virus (flu symptoms-muscle weakness, coughing, and congestion).Once enough cells become infected, you begin to feel the effects of the virus (flu symptoms-muscle weakness, coughing, and congestion).

Energy is transferred along with the genetic material and so obeys the first law of thermodynamics. Energy is transferred-not created or destroyed-in the process. When work is done on a cell or heat transfers energy to a cell, the cell's internal energy increases. When a cell does work or loses heat, its internal energy decreases. If the amount of work done by a cell is the same as the amount of energy transferred in by heat, or the amount of work performed on a cell matches the amount of energy transferred out by heat, there will be no net change in internal energy.the same as the amount of energy transferred in by heat, or the amount of work performed on a cell matches the amount of energy transferred out by heat, there will be no net change in internal energy.

Recall from the chapter introduction that it is not even theoretically possible for engines to be 100 percent efficient. This phenomenon is explained by the second law of thermodynamics, which relies on a concept known as entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. Entropy also describes how much energy is not available to do work. The more disordered a system and higher the entropy, the less of a system's energy is available to do work.The more disordered a system and higher the entropy, the less of a system's energy is available to do work.

Although all forms of energy can be used to do work, it is not possible to use the entire available energy for work. Consequently, not all energy transferred by heat can be converted into work, and some of it is lost in the form of waste heat - that is, heat that does not go toward doing work. The unavailability of energy is important in thermodynamics; in fact, the field originated from efforts to convert heat to work, as is done by engines.The unavailability of energy is important in thermodynamics; in fact, the field originated from efforts to convert heat to work, as is done by engines.

$Q$ is positive for energy transferred into the system by heat and negative for energy transferred out of the system by heat. In SI, entropy is expressed in units of joules per kelvin $( / )$. If temperature changes during the process, then it is usually a good approximation (for small changes in temperature) to take $T$ to be the average temperature in order to avoid trickier math (calculus).temperature changes during the process, then it is usually a good approximation (for small changes in temperature) to take $T$ to be the average temperature in order to avoid trickier math (calculus).


Absolute temperature is the temperature measured in Kelvins. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale that is measured in terms of the number of degrees above absolute zero. All temperatures are therefore positive. Using temperatures from another, nonabsolute scale, such as Fahrenheit or Celsius, will give the wrong answer.Using temperatures from another, nonabsolute scale, such as Fahrenheit or Celsius, will give the wrong answer.


Have you ever played the card game 52 pickup? If so, you have been on the receiving end of a practical joke and, in the process, learned a valuable lesson about the nature of the universe as described by the second law of thermodynamics. In the game of 52 pickup, the prankster tosses an entire deck of playing cards onto the floor, and you get to pick them up. In the process of picking up the cards, you may have noticed that the amount of work required to restore the cards to an orderly state in the deck is much greater than the amount of work required to toss the cards and create the disorder., you may have noticed that the amount of work required to restore the cards to an orderly state in the deck is much greater than the amount of work required to toss the cards and create the disorder.

The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process; it never decreases. An important implication of this law is that heat transfers energy spontaneously from higher- to lower-temperature objects, but never spontaneously in the reverse direction. This is because entropy increases for heat transfer of energy from hot to cold (Figure 12.9). Because the change in entropy is $Q / T$, there is a larger change in $ S$ at lower temperatures (smaller $T$ ). The decrease in entropy of the hot (larger $T$ ) object is therefore less than the increase in entropy of the cold (smaller $T$ ) object, producing an overall increase in entropy for the system.The decrease in entropy of the hot (larger $T$ ) object is therefore less than the increase in entropy of the cold (smaller $T$ ) object, producing an overall increase in entropy for the system.

Figure 12.9 The ice in this drink is slowly melting. Eventually, the components of the liquid will reach thermal equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics-that is, after heat transfers energy from the warmer liquid to the colder ice. (Jon Sullivan, )(Jon Sullivan, )

Another way of thinking about this is that it is impossible for any process to have, as its sole result, heat transferring energy from a cooler to a hotter object. Heat cannot transfer energy spontaneously from colder to hotter, because the entropy of the
overall system would decrease.Heat cannot transfer energy spontaneously from colder to hotter, because the entropy of the

Suppose we mix equal masses of water that are originally at two different temperatures, say $20.0^{ $ and $40.0{ }^{ $. The result will be water at an intermediate temperature of $30.0^{ $. Three outcomes have resulted: entropy has increased, some energy has become unavailable to do work, and the system has become less orderly. Let us think about each of these results.Let us think about each of these results.

First, why has entropy increased? Mixing the two bodies of water has the same effect as the heat transfer of energy from the higher-temperature substance to the lower-temperature substance. The mixing decreases the entropy of the hotter water but increases the entropy of the colder water by a greater amount, producing an overall increase in entropy.The mixing decreases the entropy of the hotter water but increases the entropy of the colder water by a greater amount, producing an overall increase in entropy.

Second, once the two masses of water are mixed, there is no more temperature difference left to drive energy transfer by heat and therefore to do work. The energy is still in the water, but it is now unavailable to do work.The energy is still in the water, but it is now unavailable to do work.

Third, the mixture is less orderly, or to use another term, less structured. Rather than having two masses at different temperatures and with different distributions of molecular speeds, we now have a single mass with a broad distribution of molecular speeds, the average of which yields an intermediate temperature.ent temperatures and with different distributions of molecular speeds, we now have a single mass with a broad distribution of molecular speeds, the average of which yields an intermediate temperature.

These three results-entropy, unavailability of energy, and disorder-not only are related but are, in fact, essentially equivalent. Heat transfer of energy from hot to cold is related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be available for use as work.Heat transfer of energy from hot to cold is related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be available for use as work.

Based on this law, what cannot happen? A cold object in contact with a hot one never spontaneously transfers energy by heat to the hot object, getting colder while the hot object gets hotter. Nor does a hot, stationary automobile ever spontaneously cool off and start moving.Nor does a hot, stationary automobile ever spontaneously cool off and start moving.

Another example is the expansion of a puff of gas introduced into one corner of a vacuum chamber. The gas expands to fill the chamber, but it never regroups on its own in the corner. The random motion of the gas molecules could take them all back to the corner, but this is never observed to happen (Figure 12.10).The random motion of the gas molecules could take them all back to the corner, but this is never observed to happen (Figure 12.10).

We've explained that heat never transfers energy spontaneously from a colder to a hotter object. The key word here is spontaneously. If we do work on a system, it is possible to transfer energy by heat from a colder to hotter object. We'll learn more about this in the next section, covering refrigerators as one of the applications of the laws of thermodynamics.We'll learn more about this in the next section, covering refrigerators as one of the applications of the laws of thermodynamics.

Sometimes people misunderstand the second law of thermodynamics, thinking that based on this law, it is impossible for entropy to decrease at any particular location. But, it actually is possible for the entropy of one part of the universe to decrease, as long as the total change in entropy of the universe increases. In equation form, we can write this asIn equation form, we can write this as

$ S_{ {tot }}= S_{ {syst }}+ S_{ {envir }}>0$.$ S_{ {tot }}= S_{ {syst }}+ S_{ {envir }}>0$.

Based on this equation, we see that $ S_{ {syst }}$ can be negative as long as $ S_{ {envir }}$ is positive and greater in magnitude.Based on this equation, we see that $ S_{ {syst }}$ can be negative as long as $ S_{ {envir }}$ is positive and greater in magnitude.

How is it possible for the entropy of a system to decrease? Energy transfer is necessary. If you pick up marbles that are scattered about the room and put them into a cup, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. If you gather iron ore from the ground and convert it into steel and build a bridge, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. Energy coming from the sun can decrease the entropy of local systems on Earth-that is, $ S_{ {syst }}$ is negative. But the overall entropy of the rest of the universe increases by a greater amount-that is, $ S_{ {envir }}$ is positive and greater in magnitude. In the case of the iron ore, although you made the system of the bridge and steel more structured, you did so at the expense of the universe. Altogether, the entropy of the universe is increased by the disorder created by digging up the ore and converting it to steel. Therefore,Therefore,


 S_{}= S_{}+ S_{}>0

 S_{}= S_{}+ S_{}>0

Every time a plant stores some solar energy in the form of chemical potential energy, or an updraft of warm air lifts a soaring bird, Earth experiences local decreases in entropy as it uses part of the energy transfer from the sun into deep space to do work. There is a large total increase in entropy resulting from this massive energy transfer. A small part of this energy transfer by heat is stored in structured systems on Earth, resulting in much smaller, local decreases in entropy.A small part of this energy transfer by heat is stored in structured systems on Earth, resulting in much smaller, local decreases in entropy.


Entropy is related not only to the unavailability of energy to do work; it is also a measure of disorder. For example, in the case of a melting block of ice, a highly structured and orderly system of water molecules changes into a disorderly liquid, in which molecules have no fixed positions (Figure 12.11). There is a large increase in entropy for this process, as we'll see in the following worked example.There is a large increase in entropy for this process, as we'll see in the following worked example.

One of the most important things we can do with heat is to use it to do work for us. A heat engine does exactly this-it makes use of the properties of thermodynamics to transform heat into work. Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam turbines that generate electricity are all examples of heat engines.Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam turbines that generate electricity are all examples of heat engines.

Figure 12.13 illustrates one of the ways in which heat transfers energy to do work. Fuel combustion releases chemical energy that heat transfers throughout the gas in a cylinder. This increases the gas temperature, which in turn increases the pressure of the gas and, therefore, the force it exerts on a movable piston. The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston through some distance. Thus, heat transfer of energy to the gas in the cylinder results in work being done.Thus, heat transfer of energy to the gas in the cylinder results in work being done.

Figure 12.13 (a) Heat transfer to the gas in a cylinder increases the internal energy of the gas, creating higher pressure and temperature. (b) The force exerted on the movable cylinder does work as the gas expands. Gas pressure and temperature decrease during expansion, indicating that the gas's internal energy has decreased as it does work. (c) Heat transfer of energy to the environment further reduces pressure in the gas, so that the piston can more easily return to its starting position.(c) Heat transfer of energy to the environment further reduces pressure in the gas, so that the piston can more easily return to its starting position.

To repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point. Heat now transfers energy from the gas to the surroundings, so that the gas's pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance.Heat now transfers energy from the gas to the surroundings, so that the gas's pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance.

A cyclical process brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle. All heat engines use cyclical processes.All heat engines use cyclical processes.

Heat engines do work by using part of the energy transferred by heat from some source. As shown in Figure 12.14, heat transfers energy, $Q_{}$, from the high-temperature object (or hot reservoir), whereas heat transfers unused energy, $Q_{}$, into the lowtemperature object (or cold reservoir), and the work done by the engine is $W$. In physics, a reservoir is defined as an infinitely large mass that can take in or put out an unlimited amount of heat, depending upon the needs of the system. The temperature of the hot reservoir is $T_{}$, and the temperature of the cold reservoir is $T_{}$.The temperature of the hot reservoir is $T_{}$, and the temperature of the cold reservoir is $T_{}$.

The hot and cold objects are called the hot and cold reservoirs. $Q_{}$ is the heat out of the hot reservoir, $W$ is the work output, and $Q_{}$ is the unused heat into the cold reservoir.$Q_{}$ is the heat out of the hot reservoir, $W$ is the work output, and $Q_{}$ is the unused heat into the cold reservoir.

As noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system's internal energy, $U$, is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle-that is, $ U=0$. The first law of thermodynamics states that $ U=Q-W$, where $Q$ is the net heat transfer during the cycle, and $W$ is the net work done by the system. The net heat transfer is the energy transferred in by heat from the hot reservoir minus the amount that is transferred out to the cold reservoir ( $Q=Q_{}$ ). Because there is no change in internal energy for a complete cycle ( $ U=0$ ), we haveBecause there is no change in internal energy for a complete cycle ( $ U=0$ ), we have


0=Q-W,

Because the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is an energy-intensive process, it is important that the work be done as efficiently as possible. In fact, we want $W$ to equal $Q_{}$, and for there to be no heat to the environment (that is, $Q_{}=0$ ). Unfortunately, this is impossible. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat engines cannot have perfect conversion of heat into work. Recall that entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system, which is also how much energy is unavailable to do work. The second law of thermodynamics requires that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any process. Therefore, there is a minimum amount of $Q_{}$ that cannot be used for work. The amount of heat rejected to the cold reservoir, $Q_{}$, depends upon the efficiency of the heat engine. The smaller the increase in entropy, $ S$, the smaller the value of $Q_{}$, and the more heat energy is available to do work.The smaller the increase in entropy, $ S$, the smaller the value of $Q_{}$, and the more heat energy is available to do work.

Heat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators utilize heat transfer of energy from low to high temperatures, which is the opposite of what heat engines do. Heat transfers energy $Q_{}$ from a cold reservoir and delivers energy $Q_{}$ into a hot one. This requires work input, $W$, which produces a transfer of energy by heat. Therefore, the total heat transfer to the hot reservoir isTherefore, the total heat transfer to the hot reservoir is

The purpose of a heat pump is to transfer energy by heat to a warm environment, such as a home in the winter. The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm rather than just burning fuel in a fireplace or furnace is that a heat pump supplies $Q_{}+W$. Heat $Q_{}$ comes from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space. You only pay for $W$, and you get an additional heat transfer of $Q_{}$ from the outside at no cost. In many cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage to a heat pump is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes
more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is provided by electrical energy.tage to a heat pump is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes

The basic components of a heat pump are shown in Figure 12.15. A working fluid, such as a refrigerant, is used. In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat $Q_{}$ enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat $Q_{}$ enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.

Figure 12.15 A simple heat pump has four basic components: (1) an evaporator, (2) a compressor, (3) a condenser, and (4) an expansion valve. In the heating mode, heat transfers $Q_{}$ to the working fluid in the evaporator (1) from the colder, outdoor air, turning it into a gas. The electrically driven compressor (2) increases the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils (3) inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature in the room, heat transfers energy from the gas to the room as the gas condenses into a liquid. The working fluid is then cooled as it flows back through an expansion valve (4) to the outdoor evaporator coils.The working fluid is then cooled as it flows back through an expansion valve (4) to the outdoor evaporator coils.

The electrically driven compressor (work input $W$ ) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature inside the room, heat transfers energy to the room, and the gas condenses into a liquid. The liquid then flows back through an expansion (pressure-reducing) valve. The liquid, having been cooled through expansion, returns to the outdoor evaporator coils to resume the cycle.The liquid, having been cooled through expansion, returns to the outdoor evaporator coils to resume the cycle.

Most people don't realize that they are also sharing their homes with a heat pump.Most people don't realize that they are also sharing their homes with a heat pump.

Air conditioners and refrigerators are designed to cool substances by transferring energy by heat $Q_{}$ out of a cool environment to a warmer one, where heat $Q_{}$ is given up. In the case of a refrigerator, heat is moved out of the inside of the fridge into the
surrounding room. For an air conditioner, heat is transferred outdoors from inside a home. Heat pumps are also often used in a reverse setting to cool rooms in the summer.Heat pumps are also often used in a reverse setting to cool rooms in the summer.

As with heat pumps, work input is required for heat transfer of energy from cold to hot. The quality of air conditioners and refrigerators is judged by how much energy is removed by heat $Q_{}$ from a cold environment, compared with how much work, $W$, is required. So, what is considered the energy benefit in a heat pump, is considered waste heat in a refrigerator.So, what is considered the energy benefit in a heat pump, is considered waste heat in a refrigerator.


In the conversion of energy into work, we are always faced with the problem of getting less out than we put in. The problem is that, in all processes, there is some heat $Q_{}$ that transfers energy to the environment-and usually a very significant amount at that. A way to quantify how efficiently a machine runs is through a quantity called thermal efficiency.A way to quantify how efficiently a machine runs is through a quantity called thermal efficiency.

We define thermal efficiency, Eff, to be the ratio of useful energy output to the energy input (or, in other words, the ratio of what we get to what we spend). The efficiency of a heat engine is the output of net work, $W$, divided by heat-transferred energy, $Q_{}$, into the engine; that isThe efficiency of a heat engine is the output of net work, $W$, divided by heat-transferred energy, $Q_{}$, into the engine; that is

All values of heat ( $Q_{}$ and $Q_{}$ ) are positive; there is no such thing as negative heat. The direction of heat is indicated by a plus or minus sign. For example, $Q_{}$ is out of the system, so it is preceded by a minus sign in the equation for net heat.For example, $Q_{}$ is out of the system, so it is preceded by a minus sign in the equation for net heat.

A coal-fired power station is a huge heat engine. It uses heat to transfer energy from burning coal to do work to turn turbines, which are used then to generate electricity. In a single day, a large coal power station transfers $2.50  10^{14} $ by heat from burning coal and transfers $1.48  10^{14} $ by heat into the environment.

We can use $W=Q_{}$ to find the work output, $W$, assuming a cyclical process is used in the power station. In this process, water is boiled under pressure to form high-temperature steam, which is used to run steam turbine-generators and then condensed back to water to start the cycle again.In this process, water is boiled under pressure to form high-temperature steam, which is used to run steam turbine-generators and then condensed back to water to start the cycle again.

INTRODUCTION Recall from the chapter on Motion in Two Dimensions that oscillations-the back-and-forth movement between two points-involve force and energy. Some oscillations create waves, such as the sound waves created by plucking a guitar string. Other examples of waves include earthquakes and visible light. Even subatomic particles, such as electrons, can behave like waves. You can make water waves in a swimming pool by slapping the water with your hand. Some of these waves, such as water waves, are visible; others, such as sound waves, are not. But every wave is a disturbance that moves from its source and carries energy. In this chapter, we will learn about the different types of waves, their properties, and how they interact with one another.In this chapter, we will learn about the different types of waves, their properties, and how they interact with one another.

What do we mean when we say something is a wave? A wave is a disturbance that travels or propagates from the place where it was created. Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any mass. Light, sound, and waves in the ocean are common examples of waves. Sound and water waves are mechanical waves; meaning, they require a medium to travel through. The medium may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and the speed of the wave depends on the material properties of the medium through which it is traveling. However, light is not a mechanical wave; it can travel through a vacuum such as the empty parts of outer space.However, light is not a mechanical wave; it can travel through a vacuum such as the empty parts of outer space.

A familiar wave that you can easily imagine is the water wave. For water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, an example of which is the disturbance created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the water surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in air pressure, an example of which is when the oscillating cone inside a speaker creates a disturbance. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, which include the disturbance of Earth's surface itself and the pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily understood using an analogy with water waves. Because water waves are common and visible, visualizing water waves may help you in studying other types of waves, especially those that are not visible.Because water waves are common and visible, visualizing water waves may help you in studying other types of waves, especially those that are not visible.

Water waves have characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency, and energy, which we will discuss in the next section.Water waves have characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency, and energy, which we will discuss in the next section.


If you drop a pebble into the water, only a few waves may be generated before the disturbance dies down, whereas in a wave pool, the waves are continuous. A pulse wave is a sudden disturbance in which only one wave or a few waves are generated, such as in the example of the pebble. Thunder and explosions also create pulse waves. A periodic wave repeats the same oscillation for several cycles, such as in the case of the wave pool, and is associated with simple harmonic motion. Each particle in the medium experiences simple harmonic motion in periodic waves by moving back and forth periodically through the same positions.Each particle in the medium experiences simple harmonic motion in periodic waves by moving back and forth periodically through the same positions.

Consider the simplified water wave in Figure 13.2. This wave is an up-and-down disturbance of the water surface, characterized by a sine wave pattern. The uppermost position is called the crest and the lowest is the trough. It causes a seagull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs pass under the bird.It causes a seagull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs pass under the bird.

Mechanical waves are categorized by their type of motion and fall into any of two categories: transverse or longitudinal. Note that both transverse and longitudinal waves can be periodic. A transverse wave propagates so that the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. An example of a transverse wave is shown in Figure 13.3, where a woman moves a toy spring up and down, generating waves that propagate away from herself in the horizontal direction while disturbing the toy spring in the vertical direction.n in Figure 13.3, where a woman moves a toy spring up and down, generating waves that propagate away from herself in the horizontal direction while disturbing the toy spring in the vertical direction.

In contrast, in a longitudinal wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation.

Longitudinal waves are sometimes called compression waves or compressional waves, and transverse waves are sometimes called shear waves.
Longitudinal waves are sometimes called compression waves or compressional waves, and transverse waves are sometimes called shear waves.

Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. The waves on the strings of musical instruments are transverse (as shown in Figure 13.5), and so are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids.Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids.

Sound in solids can be both longitudinal and transverse. Essentially, water waves are also a combination of transverse and longitudinal components, although the simplified water wave illustrated in Figure 13.2 does not show the longitudinal motion of the bird.entially, water waves are also a combination of transverse and longitudinal components, although the simplified water wave illustrated in Figure 13.2 does not show the longitudinal motion of the bird.

Earthquake waves under Earth's surface have both longitudinal and transverse components as well. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure or $$-waves, and the transverse waves are called shear or S-waves. These components have important individual characteristics; for example, they propagate at different speeds. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water.Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water.

Many people enjoy surfing in the ocean. For some surfers, the bigger the wave, the better. In one area off the coast of central California, waves can reach heights of up to 50 feet in certain times of the year (Figure 13.6).In one area off the coast of central California, waves can reach heights of up to 50 feet in certain times of the year (Figure 13.6).

How do waves reach such extreme heights? Other than unusual causes, such as when earthquakes produce tsunami waves, most huge waves are caused simply by interactions between the wind and the surface of the water. The wind pushes up against the surface of the water and transfers energy to the water in the process. The stronger the wind, the more energy transferred. As waves start to form, a larger surface area becomes in contact with the wind, and even more energy is transferred from the wind to the water, thus creating higher waves. Intense storms create the fastest winds, kicking up massive waves that travel out from the origin of the storm. Longer-lasting storms and those storms that affect a larger area of the ocean create the biggest waves since they transfer more energy. The cycle of the tides from the Moon's gravitational pull also plays a small role in creating waves.The cycle of the tides from the Moon's gravitational pull also plays a small role in creating waves.

Actual ocean waves are more complicated than the idealized model of the simple transverse wave with a perfect sinusoidal shape. Ocean waves are examples of orbital progressive waves, where water particles at the surface follow a circular path from the crest to the trough of the passing wave, then cycle back again to their original position. This cycle repeats with each passing wave.This cycle repeats with each passing wave.

As waves reach shore, the water depth decreases and the energy of the wave is compressed into a smaller volume. This creates higher waves-an effect known as shoaling.This creates higher waves-an effect known as shoaling.

Since the water particles along the surface move from the crest to the trough, surfers hitch a ride on the cascading water, gliding along the surface. If ocean waves work exactly like the idealized transverse waves, surfing would be much less exciting as it would simply involve standing on a board that bobs up and down in place, just like the seagull in the previous figure.ly like the idealized transverse waves, surfing would be much less exciting as it would simply involve standing on a board that bobs up and down in place, just like the seagull in the previous figure.

   Amplitude-distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement of the wave

In addition to amplitude, frequency, and period, their wavelength and wave velocity also characterize waves. The wavelength $ is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave, parallel to the direction of propagation. The wave velocity $v_{w}$ is the speed at which the disturbance moves.The wave velocity $v_{w}$ is the speed at which the disturbance moves.


Wave velocity is sometimes also called the propagation velocity or propagation speed because the disturbance propagates from one location to another.
Wave velocity is sometimes also called the propagation velocity or propagation speed because the disturbance propagates from one location to another.

Consider the periodic water wave in Figure 13.7. Its wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough. The wavelength can also be thought of as the distance a wave has traveled after one complete cycle-or one period. The time for one complete up-and-down motion is the simple water wave's period $T$. In the figure, the wave itself moves to the right with a wave
velocity $v_{}$. Its amplitude $X$ is the distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement-either the crest or the trough-of the wave. It is important to note that this movement of the wave is actually the disturbance moving to the right, not the water itself; otherwise, the bird would move to the right. Instead, the seagull bobs up and down in place as waves pass underneath, traveling a total distance of $2 X$ in one cycle.

These fundamental relationships hold true for all types of waves. As an example, for water waves, $v_{}$ is the speed of a surface wave; for sound, $v_{}$ is the speed of sound; and for visible light, $v_{}$ is the speed of light. The amplitude $X$ is completely independent of the speed of propagation $v_{}$ and depends only on the amount of energy in the wave.The amplitude $X$ is completely independent of the speed of propagation $v_{}$ and depends only on the amount of energy in the wave.



In this lab, you will take measurements to determine how the amplitude and the period of waves are affected by the transfer of energy from a cork dropped into the water. The cork initially has some potential energy when it is held above the water-the greater the height, the higher the potential energy. When it is dropped, such potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the cork falls. When the cork hits the water, that energy travels through the water in waves.When the cork hits the water, that energy travels through the water in waves.

Figure 13.9 The destructive effect of an earthquake is a palpable evidence of the energy carried in the earthquake waves. The Richter scale rating of earthquakes is related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Candice Villarreal, U.S. Navy)Navy)

Geologists rely heavily on physics to study earthquakes since earthquakes involve several types of wave disturbances, including disturbance of Earth's surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Surface earthquake waves are similar to surface waves on water. The waves under Earth's surface have both longitudinal and transverse components. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure waves (P-waves) and the transverse waves are called shear waves (S-waves). These two types of waves propagate at different speeds, and the speed at which they travel depends on the rigidity of the medium through which they are traveling. During earthquakes, the speed of P-waves in granite is significantly higher than the speed of S-waves. Both components of earthquakes travel more slowly in less rigid materials, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to $7  / $, and S-waves have speeds of 2 to $5  / $, but both are faster in more rigid materials. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave as they travel through Earth's crust. For that reason, the time difference between the P- and S-waves is used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake.For that reason, the time difference between the P- and S-waves is used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake.

We know from seismic waves produced by earthquakes that parts of the interior of Earth are liquid. Shear or transverse waves cannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through Earth's core. In contrast, compression or longitudinal waves can pass through a liquid and they do go through the core.In contrast, compression or longitudinal waves can pass through a liquid and they do go through the core.

All waves carry energy, and the energy of earthquake waves is easy to observe based on the amount of damage left behind after the ground has stopped moving. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls. The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground displacements and greater damage. As earthquake waves spread out, their amplitude decreases, so there is less damage the farther they get from the source.As earthquake waves spread out, their amplitude decreases, so there is less damage the farther they get from the source.

Waves superimpose by adding their disturbances; each disturbance corresponds to a force, and all the forces add.

Pure constructive interference occurs when two identical waves arrive at the same point exactly in phase. When waves are exactly in phase, the crests of the two waves are precisely aligned, as are the troughs. Refer to Figure 13.11. Because the disturbances add, the pure constructive interference of two waves with the same amplitude produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the two individual waves, but has the same wavelength.use the disturbances add, the pure constructive interference of two waves with the same amplitude produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the two individual waves, but has the same wavelength.

Figure 13.12 shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase - that is, precisely aligned crest to trough — producing pure destructive interference. Because the disturbances are in opposite directions for this superposition, the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference; that is, the waves completely cancel out each other.Because the disturbances are in opposite directions for this superposition, the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference; that is, the waves completely cancel out each other.

The superposition of most waves that we see in nature produces a combination of constructive and destructive interferences.The superposition of most waves that we see in nature produces a combination of constructive and destructive interferences.

Waves that are not results of pure constructive or destructive interference can vary from place to place and time to time. The sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and soft in another. The varying loudness means that the sound waves add partially constructively and partially destructively at different locations. A stereo has at least two speakers that create sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these waves superimpose.All these waves superimpose.

An example of sounds that vary over time from constructive to destructive is found in the combined whine of jet engines heard by a stationary passenger. The volume of the combined sound can fluctuate up and down as the sound from the two engines varies in time from constructive to destructive.The volume of the combined sound can fluctuate up and down as the sound from the two engines varies in time from constructive to destructive.

The two previous examples considered waves that are similar—both stereo speakers generate sound waves with the same amplitude and wavelength, as do the jet engines. But what happens when two waves that are not similar, that is, having different amplitudes and wavelengths, are superimposed? An example of the superposition of two dissimilar waves is shown in Figure 13.13. Here again, the disturbances add and subtract, but they produce an even more complicated-looking wave. The resultant wave from the combined disturbances of two dissimilar waves looks much different than the idealized sinusoidal shape of a periodic wave.

Sometimes waves do not seem to move and they appear to just stand in place, vibrating. Such waves are called standing waves and are formed by the superposition of two or more waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference. Standing waves created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions are illustrated in Figure 13.14.Standing waves created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions are illustrated in Figure 13.14.

Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due to reflections of waves from the ends of the string. Figure 13.15 and Figure 13.16 show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends. When the wave reaches the fixed end, it has nowhere else to go but back where it came from, causing the reflection. The nodes are the points where the string does not move; more generally, the nodes are the points where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move there.The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move there.

As we saw in the case of standing waves on the strings of a musical instrument, reflection is the change in direction of a wave when it bounces off a barrier, such as a fixed end. When the wave hits the fixed end, it changes direction, returning to its source. As it is reflected, the wave experiences an inversion, which means that it flips vertically. If a wave hits the fixed end with a crest, it will return as a trough, and vice versa (Henderson 2015). Refer to Figure 13.17.Refer to Figure 13.17.

If the end is not fixed, it is said to be a free end, and no inversion occurs. When the end is loosely attached, it reflects without
inversion, and when the end is not attached to anything, it does not reflect at all. You may have noticed this while changing the settings from Fixed End to Loose End to No End in the Waves on a String PhET simulation.You may have noticed this while changing the settings from Fixed End to Loose End to No End in the Waves on a String PhET simulation.

Rather than encountering a fixed end or barrier, waves sometimes pass from one medium into another, for instance, from air into water. Different types of media have different properties, such as density or depth, that affect how a wave travels through them. At the boundary between media, waves experience refraction - they change their path of propagation. As the wave bends, it also changes its speed and wavelength upon entering the new medium. Refer to Figure 13.18.Refer to Figure 13.18.

Figure 14.1 This tree fell some time ago. When it fell, particles in the air were disturbed by the energy of the tree hitting the ground. This disturbance of matter, which our ears have evolved to detect, is called sound. (B.A. Bowen Photography)Bowen Photography)






INTRODUCTION If a tree falls in a forest (see Figure 14.1) and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? The answer to this old philosophical question depends on how you define sound. If sound only exists when someone is around to perceive it, then the falling tree produced no sound. However, in physics, we know that colliding objects can disturb the air, water or other matter surrounding them. As a result of the collision, the surrounding particles of matter began vibrating in a wave-like fashion. This is a sound wave. Consequently, if a tree collided with another object in space, no one would hear it, because no sound would be produced. This is because, in space, there is no air, water or other matter to be disturbed and produce sound waves. In this chapter, we'll learn more about the wave properties of sound, and explore hearing, as well as some special uses for sound.In this chapter, we'll learn more about the wave properties of sound, and explore hearing, as well as some special uses for sound.

Sound is a wave. More specifically, sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward. A disturbance is anything that is moved from its state of equilibrium. Some sound waves can be characterized as periodic waves, which means that the atoms that make up the matter experience simple harmonic motion.Some sound waves can be characterized as periodic waves, which means that the atoms that make up the matter experience simple harmonic motion.

A vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in Figure 14.2, Figure 14.3, and Figure 14.4. As the string oscillates back and forth, part of the string's energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air. This creates slightly higher and lower pressures. The higher pressure... regions are compressions, and the low pressure regions are rarefactions. The pressure disturbance moves through the air as longitudinal waves with the same frequency as the string. Some of the energy is lost in the form of thermal energy transferred to the air. You may recall from the chapter on waves that areas of compression and rarefaction in longitudinal waves (such as sound) are analogous to crests and troughs in transverse waves.You may recall from the chapter on waves that areas of compression and rarefaction in longitudinal waves (such as sound) are analogous to crests and troughs in transverse waves.

Figure 14.4 After many vibrations, there is a series of compressions and rarefactions that have been transmitted from the string as a sound wave. The graph shows gauge pressure $} ) versus distance $x$ from the source. Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure; it is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it. For ordinary, everyday sounds, pressures vary only slightly from average atmospheric pressure.For ordinary, everyday sounds, pressures vary only slightly from average atmospheric pressure.

The amplitude of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread over a larger and larger area. But some of the energy is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum in Figure 14.5, and some of the energy is converted to thermal energy in the air. Figure 14.4 shows a graph of gauge pressure versus distance from the vibrating string. From this figure, you can see that the compression of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the peak of a transverse wave, and the rarefaction of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the trough of a transverse wave. Just as a transverse wave alternates between peaks and troughs, a longitudinal wave alternates between compression and rarefaction.Just as a transverse wave alternates between peaks and troughs, a longitudinal wave alternates between compression and rarefaction.

Figure 14.5 Sound wave compressions and rarefactions travel up the ear canal and force the eardrum to vibrate. There is a net force on the eardrum, since the sound wave pressures differ from the atmospheric pressure found behind the eardrum. A complicated mechanism converts the vibrations to nerve impulses, which are then interpreted by the brain.A complicated mechanism converts the vibrations to nerve impulses, which are then interpreted by the brain.


The speed of sound varies greatly depending upon the medium it is traveling through. The speed of sound in a medium is determined by a combination of the medium's rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The more rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. The greater the density of a medium, the slower the speed of sound. The speed of sound in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids and solids are relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such media is generally greater than in gases. Table 14.I shows the speed of sound in various media. Since temperature affects density, the speed of sound varies with the temperature of the medium through which it's traveling to some extent, especially for gases.Since temperature affects density, the speed of sound varies with the temperature of the medium through which it's traveling to some extent, especially for gases.

Sound, like all waves, travels at certain speeds through different media and has the properties of frequency and wavelength. Sound travels much slower than light—you can observe this while watching a fireworks display (see Figure 14.6), since the flash of an explosion is seen before its sound is heard.Sound travels much slower than light—you can observe this while watching a fireworks display (see Figure 14.6), since the flash of an explosion is seen before its sound is heard.

where $v$ is the speed of sound (in units of $ / $ ), $f$ is its frequency (in units of hertz), and $ is its wavelength (in units of meters). Recall that wavelength is defined as the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave. The wavelength of a sound, therefore, is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a sound wave. Just as the distance between adjacent crests in a transverse wave is one wavelength, the distance between adjacent compressions in a sound wave is also one wavelength, as shown in Figure 14.7. The frequency of a sound wave is the same as that of the source. For example, a tuning fork vibrating at a given frequency would produce sound waves that oscillate at that same frequency. The frequency of a sound is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.The frequency of a sound is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.

One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of frequency. If this were not the case, and high-frequency sounds traveled faster, for example, then the farther you were from a band in a football stadium, the more the sound from the low-pitch instruments would lag behind the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed.But the music from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed.

Recall that $v=f  and in a given medium under fixed temperature and humidity, $v$ is constant. Therefore, the relationship between $f$ and $ is inverse: The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength of a sound wave.Therefore, the relationship between $f$ and $ is inverse: The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength of a sound wave.

The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another. However, the frequency usually remains the same because it is like a driven oscillation and maintains the frequency of the original source. If $v$ changes and $f$ remains the same, then the wavelength $ must change. Since $v=f  the higher the speed of a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.Since $v=f  the higher the speed of a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.

It is used by animals such as bats, dolphins and whales, and is also imitated by humans in SONAR—Sound Navigation and Ranging — and echolocation technology.It is used by animals such as bats, dolphins and whales, and is also imitated by humans in SONAR—Sound Navigation and Ranging — and echolocation technology.

Bats, dolphins and whales use echolocation to navigate and find food in their environment. They locate an object (or obstacle) by emitting a sound and then sensing the reflected sound waves. Since the speed of sound in air is constant, the time it takes for the sound to travel to the object and back gives the animal a sense of the distance between itself and the object. This is called ranging. Figure 14.8 shows a bat using echolocation to sense distances.Figure 14.8 shows a bat using echolocation to sense distances.

Echolocating animals identify an object by comparing the relative intensity of the sound waves returning to each ear to figure out the angle at which the sound waves were reflected. This gives information about the direction, size and shape of the object. Since there is a slight distance in position between the two ears of an animal, the sound may return to one of the ears with a bit of a delay, which also provides information about the position of the object. For example, if a bear is directly to the right of a bat, the echo will return to the bat's left ear later than to its right ear. If, however, the bear is directly ahead of the bat, the echo would return to both ears at the same time. For an animal without a sense of sight such as a bat, it is important to know where other animals are as well as what they are; their survival depends on it.For an animal without a sense of sight such as a bat, it is important to know where other animals are as well as what they are; their survival depends on it.

Principles of echolocation have been used to develop a variety of useful sensing technologies. SONAR, is used by submarines to detect objects underwater and measure water depth. Unlike animal echolocation, which relies on only one transmitter (a mouth) and two receivers (ears), manmade SONAR uses many transmitters and beams to get a more accurate reading of the environment. Radar technologies use the echo of radio waves to locate clouds and storm systems in weather forecasting, and to locate aircraft for air traffic control. Some new cars use echolocation technology to sense obstacles around the car, and warn the driver who may be about to hit something (or even to automatically parallel park). Echolocation technologies and training systems are being developed to help visually impaired people navigate their everyday environments.Echolocation technologies and training systems are being developed to help visually impaired people navigate their everyday environments.

In a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground. But in a traffic jam filled with honking cars, you may have to shout just so the person next to you can hear Figure 14.9. The loudness of a sound is related to how energetically its source is vibrating. In cartoons showing a screaming person, the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating uvula (the hanging tissue at the back of the mouth) to represent a loud sound coming from the throat. Figure 14.10 shows such a cartoon depiction of a bird loudly expressing its opinion.Figure 14.10 shows such a cartoon depiction of a bird loudly expressing its opinion.

A useful quantity for describing the loudness of sounds is called sound intensity. In general, the intensity of a wave is the power per unit area carried by the wave. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave. In equation form, intensity $I$ isIn equation form, intensity $I$ is


I=

I=


where $P$ is the power through an area $A$. The SI unit for $I$ is $ / $. The intensity of a sound depends upon its pressure amplitude.The intensity of a sound depends upon its pressure amplitude.

The relationship between the intensity of a sound wave and its pressure amplitude (or pressure variation $ p$ ) isThe relationship between the intensity of a sound wave and its pressure amplitude (or pressure variation $ p$ ) is

I=}{2  v_{w}}


where $ is the density of the material in which the sound wave travels, in units of $ / $, and $v$ is the speed of sound in the medium, in units of $ / $. Pressure amplitude has units of pascals $()$ or $ / $. Note that $ p$ is half the difference between the maximum and minimum pressure in the sound wave.Note that $ p$ is half the difference between the maximum and minimum pressure in the sound wave.

We can see from the equation that the intensity of a sound is proportional to its amplitude squared. The pressure variation is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so I varies as $( p)^{2}$. This relationship is consistent with the fact that the sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed during the vibration. Because the power of a sound wave is the rate at which energy is transferred, the energy of a sound wave is also proportional to its amplitude squared.Because the power of a sound wave is the rate at which energy is transferred, the energy of a sound wave is also proportional to its amplitude squared.


Pressure is usually denoted by capital $P$, but we are using a lowercase $p$ for pressure in this case to distinguish it from power $P$ above.

Figure 14.10 Graphs of the pressures in two sound waves of different intensities. The more intense sound is produced by a source that has larger-amplitude oscillations and has greater pressure maxima and minima. Because pressures are higher in the greater-intensity sound, it can exert larger forces on the objects it encounters.Because pressures are higher in the greater-intensity sound, it can exert larger forces on the objects it encounters.


You may have noticed that when people talk about the loudness of a sound, they describe it in units of decibels rather than watts per meter squared. While sound intensity (in $ / $ ) is the SI unit, the sound intensity level in decibels (dB) is more relevant for how humans perceive sounds. The way our ears perceive sound can be more accurately described by the logarithm of the intensity of a sound rather than the intensity of a sound directly. The sound intensity level $ is defined to beThe sound intensity level $ is defined to be

where $I$ is sound intensity in watts per meter squared, and $I_{0}=10^{-12}  / $ is a reference intensity. $I_{0}$ is chosen as the reference point because it is the lowest intensity of sound a person with normal hearing can perceive. The decibel level of a sound having an intensity of $10^{-12}  / $ is $ $, because $ _{10} 1=0$. That is, the threshold of human hearing is 0 decibels.That is, the threshold of human hearing is 0 decibels.

Each factor of 10 in intensity corresponds to $10 $. For example, a $90 $ sound compared with a $60 $ sound is $30 $ greater, or three factors of 10 (that is, $10^{3}$ times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is $10^{7}$ as intense as another, it is $70 $ higher.Another example is that if one sound is $10^{7}$ as intense as another, it is $70 $ higher.

Since $ is defined in terms of a ratio, it is unit-less. The unit called decibel ( $$ ) is used to indicate that this ratio is multiplied by 10. The sound intensity level is not the same as sound intensity - it tells you the level of the sound relative to a reference intensity rather than the actual intensity.The sound intensity level is not the same as sound intensity - it tells you the level of the sound relative to a reference intensity rather than the actual intensity.

People create sounds by pushing air up through their lungs and through elastic folds in the throat called vocal cords. These folds
open and close rhythmically, creating a pressure buildup. As air travels up and past the vocal cords, it causes them to vibrate. This vibration escapes the mouth along with puffs of air as sound. A voice changes in pitch when the muscles of the larynx relax or tighten, changing the tension on the vocal chords. A voice becomes louder when air flow from the lungs increases, making the amplitude of the sound pressure wave greater.A voice becomes louder when air flow from the lungs increases, making the amplitude of the sound pressure wave greater.

Hearing is the perception of sound. It can give us plenty of information-such as pitch, loudness, and direction. Humans can normally hear frequencies ranging from approximately 20 to $20,000 $. Other animals have hearing ranges different from that of humans. Dogs can hear sounds as high as $45,000 $, whereas bats and dolphins can hear up to $110,000 $ sounds. You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing.You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing.

Sounds below $20 $ are called infrasound, whereas those above $20,000 $ are ultrasound. The perception of frequency is called pitch, and the perception of intensity is called loudness.The perception of frequency is called pitch, and the perception of intensity is called loudness.

The way we hear involves some interesting physics. The sound wave that hits our ear is a pressure wave. The ear converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses, similar to a microphone.The ear converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses, similar to a microphone.

The outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the eardrum protected inside of the ear. The middle ear converts sound into mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the cochlea. The lever system of the middle ear takes the force exerted on the eardrum by sound pressure variations, amplifies it and transmits it to the inner ear via the oval window. Two muscles in the middle ear protect the inner ear from very intense sounds. They react to intense sound in a few milliseconds and reduce the force transmitted to the cochlea. This protective reaction can also be triggered by your own voice, so that humming during a fireworks display, for example, can reduce noise damage.This protective reaction can also be triggered by your own voice, so that humming during a fireworks display, for example, can reduce noise damage.

Figure 14.12 shows the middle and inner ear in greater detail. As the middle ear bones vibrate, they vibrate the cochlea, which contains fluid. This creates pressure waves in the fluid that cause the tectorial membrane to vibrate. The motion of the tectorial membrane stimulates tiny cilia on specialized cells called hair cells. These hair cells, and their attached neurons, transform the motion of the tectorial membrane into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.These hair cells, and their attached neurons, transform the motion of the tectorial membrane into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.

The tectorial membrane vibrates at different positions based on the frequency of the incoming sound. This allows us to detect the pitch of sound. Additional processing in the brain also allows us to determine which direction the sound is coming from (based on comparison of the sound's arrival time and intensity between our two ears).Additional processing in the brain also allows us to determine which direction the sound is coming from (based on comparison of the sound's arrival time and intensity between our two ears).

Figure 14.13 Playing music, also known as "rocking out", involves creating vibrations using musical instruments. (John Norton)(John Norton)

Yet another way that people make sounds is through playing musical instruments (see the previous figure). Recall that the perception of frequency is called pitch. You may have noticed that the pitch range produced by an instrument tends to depend upon its size. Small instruments, such as a piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while larger instruments, such as a tuba, typically make low-pitch sounds. High-pitch means small wavelength, and the size of a musical instrument is directly related to the wavelengths of sound it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds, just as a large instrument creates long-wavelength sounds.So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds, just as a large instrument creates long-wavelength sounds.

Most of us have excellent relative pitch, which means that we can tell whether one sound has a different frequency from another. We can usually distinguish one sound from another if the frequencies of the two sounds differ by as little as $1 $. For example, 500.0 and $501.5 $ are noticeably different.For example, 500.0 and $501.5 $ are noticeably different.

Musical notes are particular sounds that can be produced by most instruments, and are the building blocks of a song. In Western music, musical notes have particular names, such as A-sharp, C, or E-flat. Some people can identify musical notes just by listening to them. This rare ability is called perfect, or absolute, pitch.This rare ability is called perfect, or absolute, pitch.

When a violin plays middle $$, there is no mistaking it for a piano playing the same note. The reason is that each instrument produces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities. We call our perception of these combinations of frequencies and intensities the timbre of the sound. It is more difficult to quantify timbre than loudness or pitch. Timbre is more subjective. Evocative adjectives such as dull, brilliant, warm, cold, pure, and rich are used to describe the timbre of a sound rather than
quantities with units, which makes for a difficult topic to dissect with physics. So the consideration of timbre takes us into the realm of perceptual psychology, where higher-level processes in the brain are dominant. This is also true for other perceptions of sound, such as music and noise. But as a teenager, you are likely already aware that one person's music may be another person's noise.But as a teenager, you are likely already aware that one person's music may be another person's noise.

The Doppler effect is a change in the observed pitch of a sound, due to relative motion between the source and the observer. An example of the Doppler effect due to the motion of a source occurs when you are standing still, and the sound of a siren coming from an ambulance shifts from high-pitch to low-pitch as it passes by. The closer the ambulance is to you, the more sudden the shift. The faster the ambulance moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. An example of the Doppler effect with a stationary source and moving observer is if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell's frequency shift from high to low as you pass by.mple of the Doppler effect with a stationary source and moving observer is if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell's frequency shift from high to low as you pass by.

What causes the Doppler effect? Let's compare three different scenarios: Sound waves emitted by a stationary source (Figure 14.14), sound waves emitted by a moving source (Figure 14.15), and sound waves emitted by a stationary source but heard by moving observers (Figure 14.16). In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was emitted.In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was emitted.

If the source and observers are stationary, then observers on either side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the source. But if the source is moving and continues to emit sound as it travels, then the air compressions (crests) become closer together in the direction in which it's traveling and farther apart in the direction it's traveling away from. Therefore, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in Figure 14.15), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in Figure 14.15).Therefore, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in Figure 14.15), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in Figure 14.15).

Finally, if the observers move, as in Figure 14.16, the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency (and therefore shorter wavelength), and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower frequency (and therefore longer wavelength).ward the source receives them at a higher frequency (and therefore shorter wavelength), and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower frequency (and therefore longer wavelength).

Figure 14.15 Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is
reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch sound.

Figure 14.16 The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by $v=f  where $v$ is the fixed speed of sound. The sound moves in a medium and has the same speed $v$ in that medium whether the source is moving or not. Therefore, $f$ multiplied by $ is a constant. Because the observer on the right in Figure 14.15 receives a shorter wavelength, the frequency she perceives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength and therefore perceives a lower frequency.Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength and therefore perceives a lower frequency.

The same thing happens in Figure 14.16. A higher frequency is perceived by the observer moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is perceived by an observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of source and observer toward one another increases the perceived frequency. Relative motion apart decreases the perceived frequency. The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect.The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect.

Rather than just memorizing rules, which are easy to forget, it is better to think about the rules of an equation intuitively. Using a minus sign in $f_{o b s}=f_{s}  v_{s}} will decrease the denominator and increase the observed frequency, which is consistent with the expected outcome of the Doppler effect when the source is moving toward the observer. Using a plus sign will increase the denominator and decrease the observed frequency, consistent with what you would expect for the source
moving away from the observer. This may be more helpful to keep in mind rather than memorizing the fact that "the minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion away from the observer."This may be more helpful to keep in mind rather than memorizing the fact that "the minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion away from the observer."

What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound? Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency $f_{s}$. The greater the plane's speed, $v_{}$, the greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value of $f_{}$. Now, as $v_{}$ approaches the speed of sound, $v_{}, f_{}$ approaches infinity, because the denominator in $f_{o b s}=f_{s}} approaches zero.Now, as $v_{}$ approaches the speed of sound, $v_{}, f_{}$ approaches infinity, because the denominator in $f_{o b s}=f_{s}} approaches zero.

This result means that at the speed of sound, in front of the source, each wave is superimposed on the previous one because the source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the same instant, and so the frequency is theoretically infinite. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the source when it was approaching are stacked up with those from it when receding, creating a sonic boom. A sonic boom is a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound.A sonic boom is a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound.

An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail (see Figure 14.17). During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not observe the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive enough to break windows. Because of this, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.Because of this, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.

Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it while pushing down on the sustain pedal. It will sing the same note back at you-the strings that have the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces from the sound waves that you sent to them. This is a good example of the fact that objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency.This is a good example of the fact that objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency.

A driving force (such as your voice in the example) puts energy into a system at a certain frequency, which is not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system. Over time the energy dissipates, and the amplitude gradually reduces to zero-this is called damping. The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance, and a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate.The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance, and a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate.

Most of us have played with toys where an object bobs up and down on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball suspended from a finger in Figure 14.18. At first you hold your finger steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down slowly, the ball will follow along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you move your finger up and down, the ball will respond by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball at its natural frequency, the ball's oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.n the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.

Figure 14.18 The paddle ball on its rubber band moves in response to the finger supporting it. If the finger moves with the natural frequency of the ball on the rubber band, then a resonance is achieved, and the amplitude of the ball's oscillations increases dramatically. At higher and lower driving frequencies, energy is transferred to the ball less efficiently, and it responds with lower-amplitude oscillations.At higher and lower driving frequencies, energy is transferred to the ball less efficiently, and it responds with lower-amplitude oscillations.

Another example is that when you tune a radio, you adjust its resonant frequency so that it oscillates only at the desired station's broadcast (driving) frequency. Also, a child on a swing is driven (pushed) by a parent at the swing's natural frequency to reach the maximum amplitude (height). In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance.In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance.

All sound resonances are due to constructive and destructive interference. Only the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing waves, while others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing over a bottle to the recognizability of a great singer's voice, resonance and standing waves play a vital role in sound.From the toot made by blowing over a bottle to the recognizability of a great singer's voice, resonance and standing waves play a vital role in sound.

Interference happens to all types of waves, including sound waves. In fact, one way to support that something is a wave is to observe interference effects. Figure 14.19 shows a set of headphones that employs a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise. To get destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise.To get destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise.

In addition to resonance, superposition of waves can also create beats. Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves with slightly different frequencies but the same amplitude. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resultant wave an amplitude that varies over time. (See the resultant wave in Figure 14.20).(See the resultant wave in Figure 14.20).

This wave fluctuates in amplitude, or beats, with a frequency called the beat frequency. The equation for beat frequency isThe equation for beat frequency is

Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other end, as shown in Figure 14.21, Figure 14.22, and Figure 14.23. If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies it vibrates very little. This means that the air column has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a resonance at the lowest of these natural frequencies is formed. A disturbance travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes constructively with the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork.

The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an antinode) at the open end, and no displacement (a
node) at the closed end. Recall from the last chapter on waves that motion is unconstrained at the antinode, and halted at the node. The distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this equals the length of the tube; therefore, $ L$. This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as shown in Figure 14.24.This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as shown in Figure 14.24.

The fundamental and overtones can be present at the same time in a variety of combinations. For example, the note middle $$ on a trumpet sounds very different from middle $$ on a clarinet, even though both instruments are basically modified versions of a
tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the overtones and their mix of intensities are different. This mix is what gives musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they have air columns, strings, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones.In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones.

where $f_{1}$ is the fundamental, $f_{2}$ is the first overtone, $f_{3}$ is the second overtone, and so on. Note that a tube open at both ends has a fundamental frequency twice what it would have if closed at one end. It also has a different spectrum of overtones than a tube closed at one end. So if you had two tubes with the same fundamental frequency but one was open at both ends and the other was closed at one end, they would sound different when played because they have different overtones.f you had two tubes with the same fundamental frequency but one was open at both ends and the other was closed at one end, they would sound different when played because they have different overtones.

We generally take light for granted, but it is a truly amazing and mysterious form of energy. Think about it: Light travels to Earth across millions of kilometers of empty space. When it reaches us, it interacts with matter in various ways to generate almost all the energy needed to support life, provide heat, and cause weather patterns. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). The term light usually refers to visible light, but this is not the only form of EMR. As we will see, visible light occupies a narrow band in a broad range of types of electromagnetic radiation.As we will see, visible light occupies a narrow band in a broad range of types of electromagnetic radiation.

Electromagnetic radiation is generated by a moving electric charge, that is, by an electric current. As you will see when you study electricity, an electric current generates both an electric field, E, and a magnetic field, B. These fields are perpendicular to each other. When the moving charge oscillates, as in an alternating current, an EM wave is propagated. Figure 15.2 shows how an electromagnetic wave moves away from the source—indicated by the $ symbol.Figure 15.2 shows how an electromagnetic wave moves away from the source—indicated by the $ symbol.

As mentioned, electromagnetic radiation takes several forms. These forms are characterized by a range of frequencies. Because frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, any form of EMR can also be represented by its range of wavelengths.

Take a few minutes to study the positions of the various types of radiation on the EM spectrum, above. Sometimes all radiation with frequencies lower than those of visible light are referred to as infrared (IR) radiation. This includes radio waves, which overlap with the frequencies used for media broadcasts of TV and radio signals. The microwave radiation that you see on the diagram is the same radiation that is used in a microwave oven.

All the high-frequency radiation to the right of visible light is sometimes referred to as ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This includes $$-rays and gamma $( rays.

The Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is regarded widely to have been the greatest theoretical physicist of the
nineteenth century. Although he died young, Maxwell not only formulated a complete electromagnetic theory, represented by Maxwell's equations, he also developed the kinetic theory of gases, and made significant contributions to the understanding of color vision and the nature of Saturn's rings.tic theory, represented by Maxwell's equations, he also developed the kinetic theory of gases, and made significant contributions to the understanding of color vision and the nature of Saturn's rings.

Maxwell brought together all the work that had been done by brilliant physicists, such as Ørsted, Coulomb, Ampere, Gauss, and Faraday, and added his own insights to develop the overarching theory of electromagnetism. Maxwell's equations are paraphrased here in words because their mathematical content is beyond the level of this text. However, the equations illustrate how apparently simple mathematical statements can elegantly unite and express a multitude of concepts-why mathematics is the language of science.However, the equations illustrate how apparently simple mathematical statements can elegantly unite and express a multitude of concepts-why mathematics is the language of science.

Maxwell's complete theory shows that electric and magnetic forces are not separate, but different manifestations of the same thing-the electromagnetic force. This classical unification of forces is one motivation for current attempts to unify the four basic forces in nature-the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. The weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces have been unified, and further unification with the strong nuclear force is expected; but, the unification of the gravitational force with the other three has proven to be a real head-scratcher.orces have been unified, and further unification with the strong nuclear force is expected; but, the unification of the gravitational force with the other three has proven to be a real head-scratcher.

One final accomplishment of Maxwell was his development in 1855 of a process that could produce color photographic images. In 1861, he and photographer Thomas Sutton worked together on this process. The color image was achieved by projecting red, blue, and green light through black-and-white photographs of a tartan ribbon, each photo itself exposed in different-colored light. The final image was projected onto a screen (see Figure 15.4).The final image was projected onto a screen (see Figure 15.4).

All the EM waves mentioned above are basically the same form of radiation. They can all travel across empty space, and they all
travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. The basic difference between types of radiation is their differing frequencies. Each frequency has an associated wavelength. As frequency increases across the spectrum, wavelength decreases. Energy also increases with frequency. Because of this, higher frequencies penetrate matter more readily. Some of the properties and uses of the various EM spectrum bands are listed in Table 15.1.Some of the properties and uses of the various EM spectrum bands are listed in Table 15.1.

The narrow band of visible light is a combination of the colors of the rainbow. Figure 15.5 shows the section of the EM spectrum that includes visible light. The frequencies corresponding to these wavelengths are $4.0  10^{14} $ at the red end to $7.9  10^{14} $ at the violet end. This is a very narrow range, considering that the EM spectrum spans about 20 orders of magnitude.This is a very narrow range, considering that the EM spectrum spans about 20 orders of magnitude.

As a child, you probably learned the color wheel, shown on the left in Figure 15.6. It helps if you know what color results when you mix different colors of paint together. Mixing two of the primary pigment colors-magenta, yellow, or cyan-together results in a secondary color. For example, mixing cyan and yellow makes green. This is called subtractive color mixing. Mixing different colors of light together is quite different. The diagram on the right shows additive color mixing. In this case, the primary colors are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Mixing pigments and mixing light are different because materials absorb light by a different set of rules than does the perception of light by the eye. Notice that, when all colors are subtracted, the result is no color, or black. When all colors are added, the result is white light. We see the reverse of this when white sunlight is separated into the visible spectrum by a prism or by raindrops when a rainbow appears in the sky.We see the reverse of this when white sunlight is separated into the visible spectrum by a prism or by raindrops when a rainbow appears in the sky.

Color is detected by cells in the eye called cones. Humans have three cones that are sensitive to three different ranges of electromagnetic wavelengths. They are called red, blue, and green cones, although these colors do not correspond exactly to the centers of the three ranges. The ranges of wavelengths that each cone detects are red, 500 to $700 $; green, 450 to $630 $; and blue, 400 to $500 $.The ranges of wavelengths that each cone detects are red, 500 to $700 $; green, 450 to $630 $; and blue, 400 to $500 $.

Most primates also have three kinds of cones and see the world much as we do. Most mammals other than primates only have two cones and have a less colorful view of things. Dogs, for example see blue and yellow, but are color blind to red and green. You might think that simpler species, such as fish and insects, would have less sophisticated vision, but this is not the case. Many birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects have four or five different cones in their eyes. These species don't have a wider range of perceived colors, but they see more hues, or combinations of colors. Also, some animals, such as bees or rattlesnakes, see a
range of colors that is as broad as ours, but shifted into the ultraviolet or infrared.Also, some animals, such as bees or rattlesnakes, see a
range of colors that is as broad as ours, but shifted into the ultraviolet or infrared.

These differences in color perception are generally adaptations that help the animals survive. Colorful tropical birds and fish display some colors that are too subtle for us to see. These colors are believed to play a role in the species mating rituals.

Humans have found uses for every part of the electromagnetic spectrum. We will take a look at the uses of each range of frequencies, beginning with visible light. Most of our uses of visible light are obvious; without it our interaction with our surroundings would be much different. We might forget that nearly all of our food depends on the photosynthesis process in plants, and that the energy for this process comes from the visible part of the spectrum. Without photosynthesis, we would also have almost no oxygen in the atmosphere.Without photosynthesis, we would also have almost no oxygen in the atmosphere.

The low-frequency, infrared region of the spectrum has many applications in media broadcasting. Television, radio, cell phone, and remote-control devices all broadcast and/or receive signals with these wavelengths. AM and FM radio signals are both lowfrequency radiation. They are in different regions of the spectrum, but that is not their basic difference. AM and FM are abbreviations for amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Information in AM signals has the form of changes in amplitude of the radio waves; information in FM signals has the form of changes in wave frequency.Information in AM signals has the form of changes in amplitude of the radio waves; information in FM signals has the form of changes in wave frequency.

Another application of long-wavelength radiation is found in microwave ovens. These appliances cook or warm food by irradiating it with EM radiation in the microwave frequency range. Most kitchen microwaves use a frequency of $2.45  10^{9}$ Hz. These waves have the right amount of energy to cause polar molecules, such as water, to rotate faster. Polar molecules are those that have a partial charge separation. The rotational energy of these molecules is given up to surrounding matter as heat. The first microwave ovens were called Radaranges because they were based on radar technology developed during World War II.The first microwave ovens were called Radaranges because they were based on radar technology developed during World War II.

Radar uses radiation with wavelengths similar to those of microwaves to detect the location and speed of distant objects, such as airplanes, weather formations, and motor vehicles. Radar information is obtained by receiving and analyzing the echoes of microwaves reflected by an object. The speed of the object can be measured using the Doppler shift of the returning waves. This is the same effect you learned about when you studied sound waves. Like sound waves, EM waves are shifted to higher frequencies by an object moving toward an observer, and to lower frequencies by an object moving away from the observer. Astronomers use this same Doppler effect to measure the speed at which distant galaxies are moving away from us. In this case, the shift in frequency is called the red shift, because visible frequencies are shifted toward the lower-frequency, red end of the spectrum.In this case, the shift in frequency is called the red shift, because visible frequencies are shifted toward the lower-frequency, red end of the spectrum.

Exposure to any radiation with frequencies greater than those of visible light carries some health hazards. All types of radiation in this range are known to cause cell damage. The danger is related to the high energy and penetrating ability of these EM waves. The likelihood of being harmed by any of this radiation depends largely on the amount of exposure. Most people try to reduce exposure to UV radiation from sunlight by using sunscreen and protective clothing. Physicians still use X-rays to diagnose medical problems, but the intensity of the radiation used is extremely low. Figure 15.8 shows an X-ray image of a patient's chest cavity.Figure 15.8 shows an X-ray image of a patient's chest cavity.

One medical-imaging technique that involves no danger of exposure is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is an important imaging and research tool in medicine, producing highly detailed two- and three-dimensional images. Radio waves are broadcast, absorbed, and reemitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of nuclei, usually hydrogen nuclei-protons.Radio waves are broadcast, absorbed, and reemitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of nuclei, usually hydrogen nuclei-protons.

In a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same incredible speed of $3.00  10^{8}  / $, which is equal to 671 million miles per hour. This is one of the fundamental physical constants. It is referred to as the speed of light and is given the symbol $c$. The space between celestial bodies is a near vacuum, so the light we see from the Sun, stars, and other planets has traveled here at the speed of light. Keep in mind that all EM radiation travels at this speed. All the different wavelengths of radiation that leave the Sun make the trip to Earth in the same amount of time. That trip takes 8.3 minutes. Light from the nearest star, besides the Sun, takes 4.2 years to reach Earth, and light from the nearest galaxy—a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way—travels 25,000 years on its way to Earth. You can see why we call very long distances astronomical.You can see why we call very long distances astronomical.

When light travels through a physical medium, its speed is always less than the speed of light. For example, light travels in water at three-fourths the value of $c$. In air, light has a speed that is just slightly slower than in empty space: 99.97 percent of $c$. Diamond slows light down to just 41 percent of $c$. When light changes speeds at a boundary between media, it also changes direction. The greater the difference in speeds, the more the path of light bends. In other chapters, we look at this bending, called refraction, in greater detail. We introduce refraction here to help explain a phenomenon called thin-film interference.We introduce refraction here to help explain a phenomenon called thin-film interference.

Have you ever wondered about the rainbow colors you often see on soap bubbles, oil slicks, and compact discs? This occurs when light is both refracted by and reflected from a very thin film. The diagram shows the path of light through such a thin film. The symbols $n_{1}, n_{2}$, and $n_{3}$ indicate that light travels at different speeds in each of the three materials. Learn more about this topic in the chapter on diffraction and interference.Learn more about this topic in the chapter on diffraction and interference.

Figure 15.9 shows the result of thin film interference on the surface of soap bubbles. Because ray 2 travels a greater distance, the two rays become out of phase. That is, the crests of the two emerging waves are no longer moving together. This causes interference, which reinforces the intensity of the wavelengths of light that create the bands of color. The color bands are separated because each color has a different wavelength. Also, the thickness of the film is not uniform, and different thicknesses cause colors of different wavelengths to interfere in different places. Note that the film must be very, very thin —somewhere in the vicinity of the wavelengths of visible light.Note that the film must be very, very thin —somewhere in the vicinity of the wavelengths of visible light.

You have probably experienced how polarized sunglasses reduce glare from the surface of water or snow. The effect is caused by the wave nature of light. Looking back at, we see that the electric field moves in only one direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Light from most sources vibrates in all directions perpendicular to propagation. Light with an electric field that vibrates in only one direction is called polarized. A diagram of polarized light would look like .A diagram of polarized light would look like .

Polarized glasses are an example of a polarizing filter. These glasses absorb most of the horizontal light waves and transmit the vertical waves. This cuts down glare, which is caused by horizontal waves. Figure 15.10 shows how waves traveling along a rope can be used as a model of how a polarizing filter works. The oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized. Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized. If a vertical slit is placed on the first rope, the waves pass through. However, a vertical slit blocks the horizontally polarized waves. For EM waves, the direction of the electric field oscillation is analogous to the disturbances on the ropes.For EM waves, the direction of the electric field oscillation is analogous to the disturbances on the ropes.

We can use the speed of light, $c$, to carry out several simple but interesting calculations. If we know the distance to a celestial object, we can calculate how long it takes its light to reach us. Of course, we can also make the reverse calculation if we know the time it takes for the light to travel to us. For an object at a very great distance from Earth, it takes many years for its light to reach us. This means that we are looking at the object as it existed in the distant past. The object may, in fact, no longer exist. Very large distances in the universe are measured in light years. One light year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is $9.46  10^{12}$ kilometers or $5.88  10^{12}$ miles (...and $10^{12}$ is a trillion!).One light year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is $9.46  10^{12}$ kilometers or $5.88  10^{12}$ miles (...and $10^{12}$ is a trillion!).

The frequency of a wave is proportional to the energy the wave carries. The actual proportionality constant will be discussed in a later chapter. Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, we also know that wavelength is inversely proportional to energy. Keep these relationships in mind as general rules.Keep these relationships in mind as general rules.

The rate at which light is radiated from a source is called luminous flux, $P$, and it is measured in lumens (lm). Energy-saving light bulbs, which provide more luminous flux for a given use of electricity, are now available. One of these bulbs is called a compact fluorescent lamp; another is an $L E D$ (light-emitting diode) bulb. If you wanted to replace an old incandescent bulb with an energy saving bulb, you would want the new bulb to have the same brightness as the old one. To compare bulbs accurately, you would need to compare the lumens each one puts out. Comparing wattage-that is, the electric power used—would be
misleading. Both wattage and lumens are stated on the packaging.Both wattage and lumens are stated on the packaging.

The luminous flux of a bulb might be $2,000 $. That accounts for all the light radiated in all directions. However, what we really need to know is how much light falls on an object, such as a book, at a specific distance. The number of lumens per square meter is called illuminance, and is given in units of lux (lx). Picture a light bulb in the middle of a sphere with a 1 -m radius. The total surface of the sphere equals $4  r^{2} $. The illuminance then is given byThe illuminance then is given by

What happens if the radius of the sphere is increased $2 $ ? The illuminance is now only one-fourth as great, because the $r^{2}$ term in the denominator is 4 instead of 1 .

   Design an experiment to observe the phenomenon of thin-film interference. Observe colors of visible light, and relate each color to its corresponding wavelength. Comparison with the magnitudes of visible light wavelength will give an appreciation of just how very thin a thin film is. Thin-film interference has a number of practical applications, such as anti-reflection coatings and optical filters. Thin films used in filters can be designed to reflect or transmit specific wavelengths of light. This is done by depositing a film one molecular layer at a time from a vapor, thus allowing the thickness of the film to be exactly controlled.

It is convenient to divide optics into two major parts based on the size of objects that light encounters. When light interacts with an object that is several times as large as the light's wavelength, its observable behavior is similar to a ray; it does not display its
wave characteristics prominently. We call this part of optics geometric optics. This chapter focuses on situations for which geometric optics is suited.This chapter focuses on situations for which geometric optics is suited.

There are three ways, as shown in Figure 16.2, in which light can travel from a source to another location. It can come directly from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Light can travel to an object through various media, such as air and glass. Light can also arrive at an object after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all these cases, light is modeled as traveling in a straight line, called a ray. Light may change direction when it encounters the surface of a different material (such as a mirror) or when it passes from one material to another (such as when passing from air into glass). It then continues in a straight line-that is, as a ray. The word ray comes from mathematics. Here it means a straight line that originates from some point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of ray guns).It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of ray guns).

Figure 16.2 Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location are shown. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth by traveling through empty space directly from the source (the Sun). (b) This light can reach a person in one of two ways. It can travel through a medium, such as air or glass, and typically travels from one medium to another. It can also reflect from an object, such as a mirror.It can also reflect from an object, such as a mirror.

Because light moves in straight lines, that is, as rays, and changes directions when it interacts with matter, it can be described through geometry and trigonometry. This part of optics, described by straight lines and angles, is therefore called geometric optics. There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter: the law of reflection, for situations in which light bounces off matter; and the law of refraction, for situations in which light passes through matter. In this section, we consider the geometric optics of reflection.In this section, we consider the geometric optics of reflection.

Whenever we look into a mirror or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we are seeing a reflection. How does the reflected light travel from the object to your eyes? The law of reflection states: The angle of reflection, $}$, equals the angle of incidence, $}$How does the reflected light travel from the object to your eyes? The law of reflection states: The angle of reflection, $}$, equals the angle of incidence, $}$

. This law governs the behavior of all waves when they interact with a smooth surface, and therefore describe the behavior of light waves as well. The reflection of light is simplified when light is treated as a ray. This concept is illustrated in Figure 16.3, which also shows how the angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray strikes it. This perpendicular line is also called the normal line, or just the normal. Light reflected in this way is referred to as specular (from the Latin word for mirror: speculum).Light reflected in this way is referred to as specular (from the Latin word for mirror: speculum).

We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but Figure 16.4, illustrates how a rough surface reflects light. Because the light is reflected from different parts of the surface at different angles, the rays go in many different directions, so the reflected light is diffused. Diffused light allows you to read a printed page from almost any angle because some of the rays go in different directions. Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from many angles. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles.A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles.

When we see ourselves in a mirror, it appears that our image is actually behind the mirror. We see the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that our image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror, $d_{}$, as the distance we stand away from the mirror, $d_{}$. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (such as behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of our imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do to our eyes, which are themselves optical instruments. An image in a mirror is said to be a virtual image, as opposed to a real image. A virtual image is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point without actually doing so.A virtual image is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point without actually doing so.

Figure 16.5 helps illustrate how a flat mirror forms an image. Two rays are shown emerging from the same point, striking the mirror, and reflecting into the observer's eye. The rays can diverge slightly, and both still enter the eye. If the rays are extrapolated backward, they seem to originate from a common point behind the mirror, allowing us to locate the image. The paths of the reflected rays into the eye are the same as if they had come directly from that point behind the mirror. Using the law of reflection - the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence-we can see that the image and object are the same distance from the mirror. This is a virtual image, as defined earlier.This is a virtual image, as defined earlier.

Some mirrors are curved instead of flat. A mirror that curves inward is called a concave mirror, whereas one that curves outward is called a convex mirror.

Ray diagrams can be used to find the point where reflected rays converge or appear to converge, or the point from which rays appear to diverge. This is called the focal point, $$. The distance from $$ to the mirror along the central axis (the line perpendicular to the center of the mirror's surface) is called the focal length, $f$.

Some telescopes also use curved mirrors and no lenses (except in the eyepieces) both to magnify images and to change the path of light. Figure 16.12 shows a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. This design uses a spherical primary concave mirror and a convex secondary mirror. The image is projected onto the focal plane by light passing through the perforated primary mirror. The effective focal length of such a telescope is the focal length of the primary mirror multiplied by the magnification of the secondary mirror. The result is a telescope with a focal length much greater than the length of the telescope itself.The result is a telescope with a focal length much greater than the length of the telescope itself.

A parabolic concave mirror has the very useful property that all light from a distant source, on reflection by the mirror surface, is directed to the focal point. Likewise, a light source placed at the focal point directs all the light it emits in parallel lines away from the mirror. This case is illustrated by the ray diagram in Figure 16.13. The light source in a car headlight, for example, is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror.The light source in a car headlight, for example, is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror.

Curved mirrors and the images they create involve a fairly small number of variables: the mirror's radius of curvature, $R$; the focal length, $f$; the distances of the object and image from the mirror, $d_{o}$ and $d_{i}$, respectively; and the heights of the object and image, $h_{o}$ and $h_{i}$, respectively. The signs of these values indicate whether the image is inverted, erect (upright), real, or virtual.

You may have noticed some odd optical phenomena when looking into a fish tank. For example, you may see the same fish appear to be in two different places (Figure 16.16). This is because light coming to you from the fish changes direction when it
leaves the tank and, in this case, light rays traveling along two different paths both reach our eyes. The changing of a light ray's direction (loosely called bending) when it passes a boundary between materials of different composition, or between layers in single material where there are changes in temperature and density, is called refraction. Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers.Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers.

Figure 16.16 Looking at the fish tank as shown, we can see the same fish in two different locations, because light changes directions when it passes from water to air. In this case, light rays traveling on two different paths change direction as they travel from water to air, and so reach the observer. Consequently, the fish appears to be in two different places. This bending of light is called refraction and is responsible for many optical phenomena.This bending of light is called refraction and is responsible for many optical phenomena.

Why does light change direction when passing from one material (medium) to another? It is because light changes speed when going from one material to another. This behavior is typical of all waves and is especially easy to apply to light because light waves have very small wavelengths, and so they can be treated as rays. Before we study the law of refraction, it is useful to discuss the speed of light and how it varies between different media.Before we study the law of refraction, it is useful to discuss the speed of light and how it varies between different media.

The speed of light is now known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light in a vacuum, $c$, is so important, and is so precisely known, that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities, and has the fixed valueIn fact, the speed of light in a vacuum, $c$, is so important, and is so precisely known, that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities, and has the fixed value

where the approximate value of $3.00  10^{8}  / $ is used whenever three-digit precision is sufficient. The speed of light through matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, given that its interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures varies.

Figure 16.17 provides an analogy for and a description of how a ray of light changes direction when it passes from one medium to another. As in the previous section, the angles are measured relative to a perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray crosses it. The change in direction of the light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed of light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. In the situations shown in Figure 16.17, medium 2 has a greater index of refraction than medium 1 . This difference in index of refraction means that the speed of light is less in medium 2 than in medium 1. Note that, in Figure 16.17(a), the path of the ray moves closer to the perpendicular when the ray slows down. Conversely, in Figure 16.17(b), the path of the ray moves away from the perpendicular when the ray speeds up. The path is exactly reversible. In both cases, you can imagine what happens by thinking about pushing a lawn mower from a footpath onto grass, and vice versa. Going from the footpath to grass, the right front wheel is slowed and pulled to the side as shown. This is the same change in direction for light when it goes from a fast medium to a slow one. When going from the grass to the footpath, the left front wheel moves faster than the others, and the mower changes direction as shown. This, too, is the same change in direction as light going from slow to fast.This, too, is the same change in direction as light going from slow to fast.

The amount that a light ray changes direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a large change in the angle of refraction.

A good-quality mirror reflects more than 90 percent of the light that falls on it; the mirror absorbs the rest. But, it would be useful to have a mirror that reflects all the light that falls on it. Interestingly, we can produce total reflection using an aspect of refraction. Consider what happens when a ray of light strikes the surface between two materials, such as is shown in Figure 16.20(a). Part of the light crosses the boundary and is refracted; the rest is reflected. If, as shown in the figure, the index of refraction for the second medium is less than the first, the ray bends away from the perpendicular. Because $n_{1}>n_{2}$, the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence-that is, $$. Now, imagine what happens as the incident angle is increased. This causes $$ to increase as well. The largest the angle of refraction, $$, can be is $90^{ as shown in Figure 16.20 (b). The critical angle, $}$, for a combination of two materials is defined to be the incident angle, $$, which produces an angle of refraction of $90^{ That is, $}$ is the incident angle for which $$. If the incident angle, $$, is greater than the critical angle, as shown in Figure 16.20 (c), then all the light is reflected back into medium 1 , a condition called total internal reflection.If the incident angle, $$, is greater than the critical angle, as shown in Figure 16.20 (c), then all the light is reflected back into medium 1 , a condition called total internal reflection.

There are several important applications of total internal reflection. Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only $24.4^{ so, when light enters a diamond, it has trouble getting back out (Figure 16.21). Although light freely enters the diamond at different angles, it can exit only if it makes an angle less than $24.4^{ with the normal to a given surface. Facets on diamonds are specifically intended to make this unlikely, so that the light can exit only in certain places. Diamonds with very few impurities are very clear, so the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated at the few places it can exit—hence the sparkle.Diamonds with very few impurities are very clear, so the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated at the few places it can exit—hence the sparkle.

Most reflections are total and the facets are placed so that light can exit only in particular ways, thus concentrating the light and making the diamond sparkle.Most reflections are total and the facets are placed so that light can exit only in particular ways, thus concentrating the light and making the diamond sparkle.

A light ray that strikes an object that consists of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from which it came. This parallel reflection is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. Such an object is called a corner reflector because the light bounces from its inside corner. Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originates. Corner reflectors are perfectly efficient when the conditions for total internal reflection are satisfied. With common materials, it is easy to obtain a critical angle that is less than $45^{ One use of these perfect mirrors is in binoculars, as shown in Figure 16.22. Another application is for periscopes used in submarines.Another application is for periscopes used in submarines.

Fiber optics are one common application of total internal reflection. In communications, fiber optics are used to transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals, and they use the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass. Because the
fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected (Figure 16.23). The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is satisfied easily by coating the outside of the fiber with a material that has an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal reflection. Rays are reflected around corners as shown in the figure, making the fibers into tiny light pipes.Rays are reflected around corners as shown in the figure, making the fibers into tiny light pipes.

Lenses are found in a huge array of optical instruments, ranging from a simple magnifying glass to the eye to a camera's zoom lens. In this section, we use the law of refraction to explore the properties of lenses and how they form images.In this section, we use the law of refraction to explore the properties of lenses and how they form images.

Some of what we learned in the earlier discussion of curved mirrors also applies to the study of lenses. Concave, convex, focal point $$, and focal length $f$ have the same meanings as before, except each measurement is made from the center of the lens instead of the surface of the mirror. The convex lens shown in Figure 16.25 has been shaped so that all light rays that enter it parallel to its central axis cross one another at a single point on the opposite side of the lens. The central axis, or axis, is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center. Such a lens is called a converging lens because of the converging effect it has on light rays. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in Figure 16.25 to illustrate how the ray changes
direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens. Because the index of refraction of the lens is greater than that of air, the ray moves toward the perpendicular as it enters and away from the perpendicular as it leaves. (This is in accordance with the law of refraction.) As a result of the shape of the lens, light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces.(This is in accordance with the law of refraction.) As a result of the shape of the lens, light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces.

Figure 16.25 Rays of light entering a convex, or converging, lens parallel to its axis converge at its focal point, F. Ray 2 lies on the axis of the lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is the focal length, $f$, of the lens. An expanded view of the path taken by ray 1 shows the perpendiculars and the angles of incidence and refraction at both surfaces.An expanded view of the path taken by ray 1 shows the perpendiculars and the angles of incidence and refraction at both surfaces.

Note that rays from a light source placed at the focal point of a converging lens emerge parallel from the other side of the lens. You may have heard of the trick of using a converging lens to focus rays of sunlight to a point. Such a concentration of light energy can produce enough heat to ignite paper.Such a concentration of light energy can produce enough heat to ignite paper.

Figure 16.26 shows a concave lens and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis (the path taken by ray 2 in the figure is the axis of the lens). The concave lens is a diverging lens because it causes the light rays to bend away (diverge) from its axis. In this case, the lens has been shaped so all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to originate from the same point, F, defined to be the focal point of a diverging lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is again called the focal length, or " $f$," of the lens. Note that the focal length of a diverging lens is defined to be negative. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in Figure 16.26 to illustrate how the shape of the lens, together with the law of refraction, causes the ray to follow its particular path and diverge.of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in Figure 16.26 to illustrate how the shape of the lens, together with the law of refraction, causes the ray to follow its particular path and diverge.

In some circumstances, a lens forms an image at an obvious location, such as when a movie projector casts an image onto a screen. In other cases, the image location is less obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We use ray
tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and we develop equations to describe the image-formation quantitatively. These are the rules for ray tracing:These are the rules for ray tracing:

Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in Figure 16.27. To find the location and size of the image formed, we trace the paths of select light rays originating from one point on the object. In this example, the originating point is the top of a woman's head. Figure 16.27 shows three rays from the top of the object that can be traced using the raytracing rules just listed. Rays leave this point traveling in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few, which have paths that are easy to trace. The first ray is one that enters the lens parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other side (rule 1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing direction (rule 3). The third ray passes through the nearer focal point on its way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). All rays that come from the same point on the top of the person's head are refracted in such a way as to cross at the same point on the other side of the lens. The image of the top of the person's head is located at this point. Rays from another point on the object, such as the belt buckle, also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown. Although three rays are traced in Figure 16.27, only two are necessary to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray-tracing rules. Before applying ray tracing to other situations, let us consider the example shown in Figure 16.27 in more detail.

Figure 16.27 Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens. Rays originating from the same point on the object are traced. The three chosen rays each follow one of the rules for ray tracing, so their paths are easy to determine. The image is located at the point where the rays cross.

Some common applications of lenses with which we are all familiar are magnifying glasses, eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. We take a look at the latter two examples, which are the most complex. We have already seen the design of a telescope that uses only mirrors in . Figure 16.29 shows the design of a telescope that uses two lenses. Part (a) of the figure shows the design of the telescope used by Galileo. It produces an upright image, which is more convenient for many applications. Part (b) shows an arrangement of lenses used in many astronomical telescopes. This design produces an inverted image, which is less of a problem when viewing celestial objects.This design produces an inverted image, which is less of a problem when viewing celestial objects.

Figure 16.29 (a) Galileo made telescopes with a convex objective and a concave eyepiece. They produce an upright image and are used in spyglasses. (b) Most simple telescopes have two convex lenses. The objective forms a case 1 image, which is the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece forms a case 2 final image that is magnified.The eyepiece forms a case 2 final image that is magnified.

Figure 16.30 shows the path of light through a typical microscope. Microscopes were first developed during the early 1600 s by eyeglass makers in the Netherlands and Denmark. The simplest compound microscope is constructed from two convex lenses, as shown schematically in Figure 16.30. The first lens is called the objective lens; it has typical magnification values from $5  to $100  In standard microscopes, the objectives are mounted such that when you switch between them, the sample remains in focus. Objectives arranged in this way are described as parfocal. The second lens, the eyepiece, also referred to as the ocular, has several lenses that slide inside a cylindrical barrel. The focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective lens and the eyepiece. The purpose of a microscope is to magnify small objects, and both lenses contribute to the final magnification. In addition, the final enlarged image is produced in a location far enough from the observer to be viewed easily because the eye cannot focus on objects or images that are too close.In addition, the final enlarged image is produced in a location far enough from the observer to be viewed easily because the eye cannot focus on objects or images that are too close.

Real lenses behave somewhat differently from how they are modeled using rays diagrams or the thin-lens equations. Real lenses produce aberrations. An aberration is a distortion in an image. There are a variety of aberrations that result from lens size, material, thickness, and the position of the object. One common type of aberration is chromatic aberration, which is related to color. Because the index of refraction of lenses depends on color, or wavelength, images are produced at different places and with different magnifications for different colors. The law of reflection is independent of wavelength, so mirrors do not have this problem. This result is another advantage for the use of mirrors in optical systems such as telescopes.This result is another advantage for the use of mirrors in optical systems such as telescopes.

Figure 16.31(a) shows chromatic aberration for a single convex lens, and its partial correction with a two-lens system. The index of refraction of the lens increases with decreasing wavelength, so violet rays are refracted more than red rays, and are thus focused closer to the lens. The diverging lens corrects this in part, although it is usually not possible to do so completely. Lenses made of different materials and with different dispersions may be used. For example, an achromatic doublet consisting of a converging lens made of crown glass in contact with a diverging lens made of flint glass can reduce chromatic aberration dramatically (Figure 16.31(b)). example, an achromatic doublet consisting of a converging lens made of crown glass in contact with a diverging lens made of flint glass can reduce chromatic aberration dramatically (Figure 16.31(b)).

The eye is perhaps the most interesting of all optical instruments. It is remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of detail and color they eye can detect. However, our eyes commonly need some correction to reach what is called normal vision, but should be called ideal vision instead. Image formation by our eyes and common vision correction are easy to analyze using geometric optics. Figure 16.32 shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina, which lies at a fixed distance from the lens. The lens of the eye adjusts its power to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. There are no receptors at the place where the optic nerve meets the eye, which is called the blind spot. An image falling on this spot cannot be seen. The variable opening (or pupil) of the eye along with chemical adaptation allows the eye to detect light intensities from the lowest observable to $10^{10}$ times greater (without damage). Ten orders of magnitude is an incredible range of detection. Our eyes perform a vast number of functions, such as sense direction, movement, sophisticated colors, and distance. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys signals received by the eye to the brain.The optic nerve conveys signals received by the eye to the brain.

Refractive indices are crucial to image formation using lenses. Table 16.4 shows refractive indices relevant to the eye. The biggest change in the refractive index-and the one that causes the greatest bending of rays-occurs at the cornea rather than the lens. The ray diagram in Figure 16.33 shows image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The rays bend according to the refractive indices provided in Table 16.4. The cornea provides about two-thirds of the magnification of the eye because the speed of light changes considerably while traveling from air into the cornea. The lens provides the remaining magnification needed to produce an image on the retina. The cornea and lens can be treated as a single thin lens, although the light rays pass through several layers of material (such as the cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the lens, and vitreous humor), changing direction at each interface. The image formed is much like the one produced by a single convex lens. This result is a case 1 image. Images formed in the eye are inverted, but the brain inverts them once more to make them seem upright.Images formed in the eye are inverted, but the brain inverts them once more to make them seem upright.

Figure 16.33 An image is formed on the retina, with light rays converging most at the cornea and on entering and exiting the lens. Rays from the top and bottom of the object are traced and produce an inverted real image on the retina. The distance to the object is drawn smaller than scale.The distance to the object is drawn smaller than scale.

As noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision - that is, the image distance, $d_{}$, must equal the lensto-retina distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, $d_{}$ must be the same for objects at all distances. The eye manages to vary the distance by varying the power (and focal length) of the lens to accommodate for objects at various distances. In Figure 16.33, you can see the small ciliary muscles above and below the lens that change the shape of the lens and, thus, the focal length.In Figure 16.33, you can see the small ciliary muscles above and below the lens that change the shape of the lens and, thus, the focal length.

The need for some type of vision correction is very common. Common vision defects are easy to understand, and some are simple to correct. Figure 16.34 illustrates two common vision defects. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant objects clearly while close objects are in focus. The nearsighted eye overconverges the nearly parallel rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina, producing a clear image. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects clearly whereas distant objects may be in focus. A farsighted eye does not converge rays from a close object sufficiently to make the rays meet on the retina. Less divergent rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image.Less divergent rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image.

Figure 16.34 (a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina; thus, they are diverging when they strike the retina, and produce a blurry image. This divergence can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful (in other words, too short a focal length) or the length of the eye being too great. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object by the time they strike the retina and produce ... blurry close vision. This poor convergence can be caused by insufficient power (in
other words, too long a focal length) in the lens or by the eye being too short.This poor convergence can be caused by insufficient power (in
other words, too long a focal length) in the lens or by the eye being too short.

Because the nearsighted eye overconverges light rays, the correction for nearsightedness involves placing a diverging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens reduces the power of an eye that has too short a focal length (Figure 16.35(a)). Because the farsighted eye underconverges light rays, the correction for farsightedness is to place a converging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens increases the power of an eye that has too long a focal length (Figure 16.35(b)).This lens increases the power of an eye that has too long a focal length (Figure 16.35(b)).

The Sun is so far away that its rays are nearly parallel when they reach Earth. The magnifying glass is a convex (or converging) lens, focusing the nearly parallel rays of sunlight. Thus, the focal length of the lens is the distance from the lens to the spot, and its power, in diopters (D), is the inverse of this distance (in reciprocal meters).Thus, the focal length of the lens is the distance from the lens to the spot, and its power, in diopters (D), is the inverse of this distance (in reciprocal meters).


The focal length of the lens is the distance from the center of the lens to the spot, which we know to be $8.00 $. Thus,Thus,

A clear glass light bulb is placed $0.75 $ from a convex lens with a $0.50 $ focal length, as shown in Figure 16.36 . Use ray tracing to get an approximate location for the image. Then, use the mirror/lens equations to calculate (a) the location of the image and (b) its magnification.

Figure 16.36 A light bulb placed $0.75 $ from a lens with a $0.50 $ focal length produces a real image on a poster board, as discussed in the previous example. Ray tracing predicts the image location and size.Ray tracing predicts the image location and size.


Because the object is placed farther away from a converging lens than the focal length of the lens, this situation is analogous to the one illustrated in the previous figure of a series of drawings showing a woman standing to the left of a lens. Ray tracing to scale should produce similar results for $d_{}$. Numerical solutions for $d_{}$ and $m$ can be obtained using the thin-lens and magnification equations, noting that $d_{0}=0.75 $ and $f=0.50 $.Numerical solutions for $d_{}$ and $m$ can be obtained using the thin-lens and magnification equations, noting that $d_{0}=0.75 $ and $f=0.50 $.


The ray tracing to scale in Figure 16.36 shows two rays from a point on the bulb's filament crossing about $1.50 $ on the far side of the lens. Thus, the image distance, $d_{}$, is about $1.50 $. Similarly, the image height based on ray tracing is greater than the object height by about a factor of two, and the image is inverted. Thus, $m$ is about -2 . The minus sign indicates the image is inverted. The lens equation can be rearranged to solve for $d_{}$ from the given information.The lens equation can be rearranged to solve for $d_{}$ from the given information.

Note that the minus sign causes the magnification to be negative when the image is inverted. Ray tracing and the use of the lens equation produce consistent results. The thin-lens equation gives the most precise results, and is limited only by the accuracy of the given information. Ray tracing is limited by the accuracy with which you draw, but it is highly useful both conceptually and visually.Ray tracing is limited by the accuracy with which you draw, but it is highly useful both conceptually and visually.



Suppose an object, such as a book page, is held $6.50 $ from a concave lens with a focal length of $-10.0 $. Such a lens could be used in eyeglasses to correct pronounced nearsightedness. What magnification is produced?What magnification is produced?


This example is identical to the preceding one, except that the focal length is negative for a concave or diverging lens.

A number of results in this example are true of all case 3 images. Magnification is positive (as calculated), meaning the image is upright. The magnification is also less than one, meaning the image is smaller than the object-in this case, a little more than half its size. The image distance is negative, meaning the image is on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is virtual. The image is closer to the lens than the object, because the image distance is smaller in magnitude than the object distance. The location of the image is not obvious when you look through a concave lens. In fact, because the image is smaller than the object, you may think it is farther away; however, the image is closer than the object—a fact that is useful in correcting nearsightedness.In fact, because the image is smaller than the object, you may think it is farther away; however, the image is closer than the object—a fact that is useful in correcting nearsightedness.

INTRODUCTION Examine a compact disc under white light, noting the colors observed and their locations on the disc. Using the $C D$, explore the spectra of a few light sources, such as a candle flame, an incandescent bulb, and fluorescent light. If you have ever looked at the reds, blues, and greens in a sunlit soap bubble and wondered how straw-colored soapy water could produce them, you have hit upon one of the many phenomena that can only be explained by the wave character of light. That and other interesting phenomena, such as the dispersion of white light into a rainbow of colors when passed through a narrow slit, cannot be explained fully by geometric optics. In such cases, light interacts with small objects and exhibits its wave characteristics. The topic of this chapter is the branch of optics that considers the behavior of light when it exhibits wave characteristics.The topic of this chapter is the branch of optics that considers the behavior of light when it exhibits wave characteristics.

where $c=3.00  10^{8}  / $ is the speed of light in vacuum, $f$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave in $ or $^{-1}$ ), and $ is its wavelength in $$. The range of visible wavelengths is approximately 380 to $750 $. As is true for all waves, light travels in straight lines and acts like a ray when it interacts with objects several times as large as its wavelength. However, when it interacts with smaller objects, it displays its wave characteristics prominently. Interference is the identifying behavior of a wave.Interference is the identifying behavior of a wave.

In Figure 17.2, both the ray and wave characteristics of light can be seen. The laser beam emitted by the observatory represents ray behavior, as it travels in a straight line. Passing a pure, one-wavelength beam through vertical slits with a width close to the wavelength of the beam reveals the wave character of light. Here we see the beam spreading out horizontally into a pattern of bright and dark regions that are caused by systematic constructive and destructive interference. As it is characteristic of wave behavior, interference is observed for water waves, sound waves, and light waves.As it is characteristic of wave behavior, interference is observed for water waves, sound waves, and light waves.

That interference is a characteristic of energy propagation by waves is demonstrated more convincingly by water waves. Figure 17.3 shows water waves passing through gaps between some rocks. You can easily see that the gaps are similar in width to the wavelength of the waves and that this causes an interference pattern as the waves pass beyond the gaps. A cross-section across the waves in the foreground would show the crests and troughs characteristic of an interference pattern.A cross-section across the waves in the foreground would show the crests and troughs characteristic of an interference pattern.

Light has wave characteristics in various media as well as in a vacuum. When light goes from a vacuum to some medium, such as water, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency, $f$, remains the same. The speed of light in a medium is $v=c / n$, where $n$ is its index of refraction. If you divide both sides of the equation $c=f  by $n$, you get $c / n=v=f  / n$. Therefore, $v=f $, where $$ is the wavelength in a medium, andTherefore, $v=f $, where $$ is the wavelength in a medium, and







where $ is the wavelength in vacuum and $n$ is the medium's index of refraction. It follows that the wavelength of light is smaller in any medium than it is in vacuum. In water, for example, which has $n=1.333$, the range of visible wavelengths is $(380 ) / 1.333$ to $(760 ) / 1.333$, or $=285-570 $. Although wavelengths change while traveling from one medium to another, colors do not, since colors are associated with frequency.Although wavelengths change while traveling from one medium to another, colors do not, since colors are associated with frequency.

The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where waves propagate. He used wavefronts, which are the points on a wave's surface that share the same, constant phase (such as all the points that make up the crest of a water wave). Huygens's principle states, "Every point on a wavefront is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is a line tangent to all of the wavelets."The new wavefront is a line tangent to all of the wavelets."

Figure 17.4 shows how Huygens's principle is applied. A wavefront is the long edge that moves; for example, the crest or the trough. Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed $v$. These are drawn later at a time, $t$, so that they have moved a distance $s=v t$. The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets and is where the wave is located at time $t$. Huygens's principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. It will be useful not only in describing how light waves propagate, but also in how they interfere.It will be useful not only in describing how light waves propagate, but also in how they interfere.

What happens when a wave passes through an opening, such as light shining through an open door into a dark room? For light, you expect to see a sharp shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and you expect no light to bend around corners into other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door, you hear it everywhere in the room and, thus, you understand that sound spreads out when passing through such an opening. What is the difference between the behavior of sound waves and light waves in this case? The answer is that the wavelengths that make up the light are very short, so that the light acts like a ray. Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door, and so it bends around corners.Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door, and so it bends around corners.

If light passes through smaller openings, often called slits, you can use Huygens's principle to show that light bends as sound does (see Figure 17.5). The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction. Diffraction is a
wave characteristic that occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for a phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is produced by waves. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through slits in Figure 17.2 is evidence that light has the properties of a wave.

The fact that Huygens's principle worked was not considered enough evidence to prove that light is a wave. People were also reluctant to accept light's wave nature because it contradicted the ideas of Isaac Newton, who was still held in high esteem. The acceptance of the wave character of light came after 1801, when the English physicist and physician Thomas Young (1773-1829) did his now-classic double-slit experiment (see Figure 17.7).The acceptance of the wave character of light came after 1801, when the English physicist and physician Thomas Young (1773-1829) did his now-classic double-slit experiment (see Figure 17.7).

When light passes through narrow slits, it is diffracted into semicircular waves, as shown in Figure 17.8 (a). Pure constructive interference occurs where the waves line up crest to crest or trough to trough. Pure destructive interference occurs where they line up crest to trough. The light must fall on a screen and be scattered into our eyes for the pattern to be visible. An analogous pattern for water waves is shown in Figure 17.8 (b). Note that regions of constructive and destructive interference move out from the slits at well-defined angles to the original beam. Those angles depend on wavelength and the distance between the slits, as you will see below.Those angles depend on wavelength and the distance between the slits, as you will see below.

The fact that the wavelength of light of one color, or monochromatic light, can be calculated from its two-slit diffraction pattern in Young's experiments supports the conclusion that light has wave properties. To understand the basis of such calculations, consider how two waves travel from the slits to the screen. Each slit is a different distance from a given point on the screen. Thus different numbers of wavelengths fit into each path. Waves start out from the slits in phase (crest to crest), but they will end up out of phase (crest to trough) at the screen if the paths differ in length by half a wavelength, interfering destructively. If the paths differ by a whole wavelength, then the waves arrive in phase (crest to crest) at the screen, interfering constructively. More generally, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any half-integral number of wavelengths $    $  etc.), then destructive interference occurs. Similarly, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any integral number of wavelengths $( 2  3  etc. $)$, then constructive interference occurs.$)$, then constructive interference occurs.

Figure 17.9 shows how to determine the path-length difference for waves traveling from two slits to a common point on a screen. If the screen is a large distance away compared with the distance between the slits, then the angle $ between the path and a line from the slits perpendicular to the screen (see the figure) is nearly the same for each path. That approximation and simple trigonometry show the length difference, $ L$, to be $d   where $d$ is the distance between the slits,That approximation and simple trigonometry show the length difference, $ L$, to be $d   where $d$ is the distance between the slits,

When rays travel straight ahead, they remain in phase and a central maximum is obtained. However, when rays travel at an angle $ relative to the original direction of the beam, each ray travels a different distance to the screen, and they can arrive in or out of phase. Thus, a ray from the center travels a distance $ / 2$ farther than the ray from the top edge of the slit, they arrive out of phase, and they interfere destructively. Similarly, for every ray between the top and the center of the slit, there is a ray between the center and the bottom of the slit that travels a distance $ / 2$ farther to the common point on the screen, and so interferes destructively. Symmetrically, there will be another minimum at the same angle below the direct ray.Symmetrically, there will be another minimum at the same angle below the direct ray.

To three digits, $633 $ is the wavelength of light emitted by the common He-Ne laser. Not by coincidence, this red color is similar to that emitted by neon lights. More important, however, is the fact that interference patterns can be used to measure wavelength. Young did that for visible wavelengths. His analytical technique is still widely used to measure electromagnetic spectra.

In 1917, Albert Einstein was thinking about photons and excited atoms. He considered an atom excited by a certain amount of energy and what would happen if that atom were hit by a photon with the same amount of energy. He suggested that the atom would emit a photon with that amount of energy, and it would be accompanied by the original photon. The exciting part is that you would have two photons with the same energy and they would be in phase. Those photons could go on to hit other excited atoms, and soon you would have a stream of in-phase photons. Such a light stream is said to be coherent. Some four decades later, Einstein's idea found application in a process called, light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Take the first letters of all the words (except by and "of") and write them in order.

An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. Such an arrangement of slits is called a diffraction grating. An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by double-slit diffraction (see and ). A diffraction grating can be manufactured by scratching glass with a sharp tool to form a number of precisely positioned parallel lines, which act like slits. Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light, as in Figure 17.13, and for reflection of light, as on the butterfly wings or the Australian opal shown in Figure 17.14, or the CD pictured in the opening illustration of this chapter. In addition to their use as novelty items, diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the fact that they form a sharper pattern than do double slits. That is, their bright regions are narrower and brighter, while their dark regions are darker. Figure 17.15 shows idealized graphs demonstrating the sharper pattern. Natural diffraction gratings occur in the feathers of certain birds. Tiny, fingerlike structures in regular patterns act as reflection gratings, producing constructive interference that gives the feathers colors not solely due to their pigmentation. The effect is called iridescence.The effect is called iridescence.

The grooves are actually one continuous groove that spirals outward from the center. Data are recorded in the grooves as binary code (zeroes and ones) in small pits. Information in the pits is detected by a laser that tracks along the groove. It gets even more complicated: The speed of rotation must be varied as the laser tracks toward the circumference so that the linear speed along the groove remains constant. There is also an error correction mechanism to prevent the laser beam from getting off track. A diffraction grating is used to create the first two maxima on either side of the track. If those maxima are not the same distance from the track, an error is indicated and then corrected.If those maxima are not the same distance from the track, an error is indicated and then corrected.

A DIC microscope separates a polarized light source into two beams polarized at right angles to each other and coherent with each other, that is, in phase. After passing through the sample, the beams are recombined and realigned so they have the same plane of polarization. They then create an interference pattern caused by the differences in their optical path and the refractive indices of the parts of the sample they passed through. The result is an image with contrast and shadowing that could not be observed with traditional optics.The result is an image with contrast and shadowing that could not be observed with traditional optics.

Where are diffraction gratings used? Diffraction gratings are key components of monochromators-devices that separate the various wavelengths of incoming light and allow a beam with only a specific wavelength to pass through. Monochromators are used, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be chosen to specifically analyze a wavelength of light emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a biopsy sample, or to help excite strategic molecules in the sample with a selected frequency of light. Another important use is in optical fiber technologies where fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific wavelengths. A range of diffraction gratings is available for selecting specific wavelengths for such use.A range of diffraction gratings is available for selecting specific wavelengths for such use.

Diffraction gratings are used in spectroscopes to separate a light source into its component wavelengths. When a material is heated to incandescence, it gives off wavelengths of light characteristic of the chemical makeup of the material. A pure substance will produce a spectrum that is unique, thus allowing identification of the substance. Spectroscopes are also used to measure wavelengths both shorter and longer than visible light. Such instruments have become especially useful to astronomers and chemists. Figure 17.18 shows a diagram of a spectroscope.Figure 17.18 shows a diagram of a spectroscope.

Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles and interfering constructively and destructively. While diffraction allows light to be used as a spectroscopic tool, it also limits the detail we can obtain in images.While diffraction allows light to be used as a spectroscopic tool, it also limits the detail we can obtain in images.

Figure 17.19 (a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular aperture. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light is obtained. This pattern is caused by diffraction similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures, too.The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures, too.

How does diffraction affect the detail that can be observed when light passes through an aperture? Figure 17.19 (b) shows the diffraction pattern produced by two point light sources that are close to one another. The pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is just barely possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they are closer together, as in Figure 17.19 (c), you cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the detail, or resolution, you can obtain. That limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.That limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.

There are many situations in which diffraction limits the resolution. The acuity of vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus light passing through a lens with a diameter of $D$ shows the diffraction effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter $D$ does. Diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter, $D$, of their primary mirror.Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter, $D$, of their primary mirror.

Early in the chapter, it was mentioned that when light passes from one medium to another, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency remains constant. The equationThe equation







shows how to the wavelength in a given medium, $$, is related to the wavelength in a vacuum, $ and the refractive index, $n$, of the medium. The equation is useful for calculating the change in wavelength of a monochromatic laser beam in various media. The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double slit. As you know from the discussion of double slits in Young's double-slit experiment, light is diffracted by, and spreads out after passing through, each slit. Rays travel at an angle $ relative to the incident direction. Each ray travels a different distance to a common point on a screen far away. The rays start in phase, and they can be in or out of phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the path lengths traveled. Each ray travels a distance that differs by $d   from that of its neighbor, where $d$ is the distance between slits. If $d   equals an integral number of wavelengths, the rays all arrive in phase, and constructive interference (a maximum) is obtained. Thus, the condition necessary to obtain constructive interference for a diffraction grating isThus, the condition necessary to obtain constructive interference for a diffraction grating is

However, the slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings than in double slits, producing fewer maxima at larger angles.However, the slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings than in double slits, producing fewer maxima at larger angles.

Just what is the resolution limit of an aperture or lens? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which, similar to the diffraction pattern of light passing through a slit, has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (see Figure 17.19 (a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter $D$, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at $  / D$, provided that the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments. The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based on diffraction was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century. The Rayleigh criterion for the diffraction limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. See Figure 17.20 (b). The first minimum is at an angle of $  / D$, so that two point objects are just resolvable if they are separated by the angleThe first minimum is at an angle of $  / D$, so that two point objects are just resolvable if they are separated by the angle

INTRODUCTION You may have been introduced to static electricity like the child sliding down the slide in the opening photograph (Figure 18.1). The zap that he is likely to receive if he touches a playmate or parent tends to bring home the lesson. But static electricity is more than just fun and games-it is put to use in many industries. The forces between electrically charged particles are used in technologies such as printers, pollution filters, and spray guns used for painting cars and trucks. Static electricity is the study of phenomena that involve an imbalance of electrical charge. Although creating this imbalance typically requires moving charge around, once the imbalance is created, it often remains static for a long time. The study of charge in motion is called electromagnetism and will be covered in a later chapter. What is electrical charge, how is it associated
with objects, and what forces does it create? These are just some of the questions that this chapter addresses.What is electrical charge, how is it associated

You may know someone who has an electric personality, which usually means that other people are attracted to this person. This saying is based on electric charge, which is a property of matter that causes objects to attract or repel each other. Electric charge comes in two varieties, which we call positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other. Thus, two positive charges repel each other, as do two negative charges. A positive charge and a negative charge attract each other.A positive charge and a negative charge attract each other.

How do we know there are two types of electric charge? When various materials are rubbed together in controlled ways, certain combinations of materials always result in a net charge of one type on one material and a net charge of the opposite type on the other material. By convention, we call one type of charge positive and the other type negative. For example, when glass is rubbed with silk, the glass becomes positively charged and the silk negatively charged. Because the glass and silk have opposite charges, they attract one another like clothes that have rubbed together in a dryer. Two glass rods rubbed with silk in this manner will repel one another, because each rod has positive charge on it. Similarly, two silk cloths rubbed in this manner will repel each other, because both cloths have negative charge. Figure 18.2 shows how these simple materials can be used to explore the nature of the force between charges.Figure 18.2 shows how these simple materials can be used to explore the nature of the force between charges.

It took scientists a long time to discover what lay behind these two types of charges. The word electric itself comes from the Greek word elektron for amber, because the ancient Greeks noticed that amber, when rubbed by fur, attracts dry straw. Almost 2,000 years later, the English physicist William Gilbert proposed a model that explained the effect of electric charge as being due to a mysterious electrical fluid that would pass from one object to another. This model was debated for several hundred years, but it was finally put to rest in 1897 by the work of the English physicist J. J. Thomson and French physicist Jean Perrin. Along with many others, Thomson and Perrin were studying the mysterious cathode rays that were known at the time to consist of particles smaller than the smallest atom. Perrin showed that cathode rays actually carried negative electrical charge. Later, Thomson's work led him to declare, "I can see no escape from the conclusion that [cathode rays] are charges of negative
electricity carried by particles of matter."Later, Thomson's work led him to declare, "I can see no escape from the conclusion that [cathode rays] are charges of negative
electricity carried by particles of matter."

It took several years of further experiments to confirm Thomson's interpretation of the experiments, but science had in fact discovered the particle that carries the fundamental unit of negative electrical charge. We now know this particle as the electron.We now know this particle as the electron.

Atoms, however, were known to be electrically neutral, which means that they carry the same amount of positive and negative charge, so their net charge is zero. Because electrons are negative, some other part of the atom must contain positive charge. Thomson put forth what is called the plum pudding model, in which he described atoms as being made of thousands of electrons swimming around in a nebulous mass of positive charge, as shown by the left-side image of Figure 18.3. His student, Ernest Rutherford, originally believed that this model was correct and used it (along with other models) to try to understand the results of his experiments bombarding gold foils with alpha particles (i.e., helium atoms stripped of their electrons). The results, however, did not confirm Thomson's model but rather destroyed it! Rutherford found that most of the space occupied by the gold atoms was actually empty and that almost all of the matter of each atom was concentrated into a tiny, extremely dense nucleus, as shown by the right-side image of Figure 18.3. The atomic nucleus was later found to contain particles called protons, each of which carries a unit of positive electric charge. ${ }^{1}$

Figure 18.3 The left drawing shows Thompson's plum-pudding model, in which the electrons swim around in a nebulous mass of positive charge. The right drawing shows Rutherford's model, in which the electrons orbit around a tiny, massive nucleus. Note that the size of the nucleus is vastly exaggerated in this drawing. Were it drawn to scale with respect to the size of the electron orbits, the nucleus would not be visible to the naked eye in this drawing. Also, as far as science can currently detect, electrons are point particles, which means that they have no size at all!Also, as far as science can currently detect, electrons are point particles, which means that they have no size at all!

Protons and electrons are thus the fundamental particles that carry electric charge. Each proton carries one unit of positive charge, and each electron carries one unit of negative charge. To the best precision that modern technology can provide, the charge carried by a proton is exactly the opposite of that carried by an electron. The SI unit for electric charge is the coulomb (abbreviated as " $$ "), which is named after the French physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb, who studied the force between charged objects. The proton carries $+1.602  10^{-19} $. and the electron carries $-1.602  10^{-19} $, . The number $n$ of protons required to make $+1.00 $ isThe number $n$ of protons required to make $+1.00 $ is


n=1.00   }{1.602  10^{-19} }=6.25  10^{18}  { protons. }
}


The same number of electrons is required to make $-1.00 $ of electric charge. The fundamental unit of charge is often represented as $e$. Thus, the charge on a proton is $e$, and the charge on an electron is $-e$. Mathematically, $e=+1.602  10^{-19} $.Mathematically, $e=+1.602  10^{-19} $.



The American physicist Robert Millikan (1868-1953) and his student Harvey Fletcher (1884-1981) were the first to make a relatively accurate measurement of the fundamental unit of charge on the electron. They designed what is now a classicThey designed what is now a classic

1Protons were later found to contain sub particles called quarks, which have fractional electric charge. But that is another story that we leave for subsequent physics courses.
experiment performed by students. The Millikan oil-drop experiment is shown in Figure 18.4. The experiment involves some concepts that will be introduced later, but the basic idea is that a fine oil mist is sprayed between two plates that can be charged with a known amount of opposite charge. Some oil drops accumulate some excess negative charge when being sprayed and are attracted to the positive charge of the upper plate and repelled by the negative charge on the lower plate. By tuning the charge on these plates until the weight of the oil drop is balanced by the electric forces, the net charge on the oil drop can be determined quite precisely.By tuning the charge on these plates until the weight of the oil drop is balanced by the electric forces, the net charge on the oil drop can be determined quite precisely.

By knowing the mass of the oil droplets and adjusting the electric charge on the plates, the charge on the oil drops can be determined with precision.By knowing the mass of the oil droplets and adjusting the electric charge on the plates, the charge on the oil drops can be determined with precision.

Millikan and Fletcher found that the drops would accumulate charge in discrete units of about $-1.59  10^{-19} $, which is within 1 percent of the modern value of $-1.60  10^{-19} $. Although this difference may seem quite small, it is actually five times greater than the possible error Millikan reported for his results!Although this difference may seem quite small, it is actually five times greater than the possible error Millikan reported for his results!

Because the charge on the electron is a fundamental constant of nature, determining its precise value is very important for all of science. This created pressure on Millikan and others after him that reveals some equally important aspects of human nature.This created pressure on Millikan and others after him that reveals some equally important aspects of human nature.

First, Millikan took sole credit for the experiment and was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in physics for this work, although his student Harvey Fletcher apparently contributed in significant ways to the work. Just before his death in 1981, Fletcher divulged that Millikan coerced him to give Millikan sole credit for the work, in exchange for which Millikan promoted Fletcher's career at Bell Labs.Just before his death in 1981, Fletcher divulged that Millikan coerced him to give Millikan sole credit for the work, in exchange for which Millikan promoted Fletcher's career at Bell Labs.

Another great scientist, Richard Feynman, points out that many scientists who measured the fundamental charge after Millikan were reluctant to report values that differed much from Millikan's value. History shows that later measurements slowly crept up from Millikan's value until settling on the modern value. Why did they not immediately find the error and correct the value, asks Feynman. Apparently, having found a value higher than the much-respected value found by Millikan, scientists would look for possible mistakes that might lower their value to make it agree better with Millikan's value. This reveals the important psychological weight carried by preconceived notions and shows how hard it is to refute them. Scientists, however devoted to logic and data they may be, are apparently just as vulnerable to this aspect of human nature as everyone else. The lesson here is that, although it is good to be skeptical of new results, you should not discount them just because they do not agree with conventional wisdom. If your reasoning is sound and your data are reliable, the conclusion demanded by the data must be seriously considered, even if that conclusion disagrees with the commonly accepted truth.If your reasoning is sound and your data are reliable, the conclusion demanded by the data must be seriously considered, even if that conclusion disagrees with the commonly accepted truth.

Because the fundamental positive and negative units of charge are carried on protons and electrons, we would expect that the total charge cannot change in any system that we define. In other words, although we might be able to move charge around, we cannot create or destroy it. This should be true provided that we do not create or destroy protons or electrons in our system. In the twentieth century, however, scientists learned how to create and destroy electrons and protons, but they found that charge is still conserved. Many experiments and solid theoretical arguments have elevated this idea to the status of a law. The law of conservation of charge says that electrical charge cannot be created or destroyed.The law of conservation of charge says that electrical charge cannot be created or destroyed.

The law of conservation of charge is very useful. It tells us that the net charge in a system is the same before and after any interaction within the system. Of course, we must ensure that no external charge enters the system during the interaction and that no internal charge leaves the system. Mathematically, conservation of charge can be expressed asMathematically, conservation of charge can be expressed as

Materials can be classified depending on whether they allow charge to move. If charge can easily move through a material, such as metals, then these materials are called conductors. This means that charge can be conducted (i.e., move) through the material rather easily. If charge cannot move through a material, such as rubber, then this material is called an insulator.If charge cannot move through a material, such as rubber, then this material is called an insulator.

Most materials are insulators. Their atoms and molecules hold on more tightly to their electrons, so it is difficult for electrons to move between atoms. However, it is not impossible. With enough energy, it is possible to force electrons to move through an insulator. However, the insulator is often physically destroyed in the process. In metals, the outer electrons are loosely bound to their atoms, so not much energy is required to make electrons move through metal. Such metals as copper, silver, and aluminum are good conductors. Insulating materials include plastics, glass, ceramics, and wood.Insulating materials include plastics, glass, ceramics, and wood.

The conductivity of some materials is intermediate between conductors and insulators. These are called semiconductors. They can be made conductive under the right conditions, which can involve temperature, the purity of the material, and the force applied to push electrons through them. Because we can control whether semiconductors are conductors or insulators, these materials are used extensively in computer chips. The most commonly used semiconductor is silicon. Figure 18.8 shows various materials arranged according to their ability to conduct electrons.Figure 18.8 shows various materials arranged according to their ability to conduct electrons.

Figure 18.8 Materials can be arranged according to their ability to conduct electric charge. The slashes on the arrow mean that there is a very large gap in conducting ability between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, but the drawing is compressed to fit on the page. The numbers below the materials give their resistivity in $  $ (which you will learn about below). The resistivity is a measure of how hard it is to make charge move through a given material.The resistivity is a measure of how hard it is to make charge move through a given material.

What happens if an excess negative charge is placed on a conducting object? Because like charges repel each other, they will push against each other until they are as far apart as they can get. Because the charge can move in a conductor, it moves to the outer surfaces of the object. Figure 18.9(a) shows schematically how an excess negative charge spreads itself evenly over the outer surface of a metal sphere.Figure 18.9(a) shows schematically how an excess negative charge spreads itself evenly over the outer surface of a metal sphere.

What happens if the same is done with an insulating object? The electrons still repel each other, but they are not able to move, because the material is an insulator. Thus, the excess charge stays put and does not distribute itself over the object. Figure 18.9(b) shows this situation.Figure 18.9(b) shows this situation.

Most objects we deal with are electrically neutral, which means that they have the same amount of positive and negative charge. However, transferring negative charge from one object to another is fairly easy to do. When negative charge is transferred from one object to another, an excess of positive charge is left behind. How do we know that the negative charge is the mobile charge? The positive charge is carried by the proton, which is stuck firmly in the nucleus of atoms, and the atoms are stuck in place in solid materials. Electrons, which carry the negative charge, are much easier to remove from their atoms or molecules and can therefore be transferred more easily.Electrons, which carry the negative charge, are much easier to remove from their atoms or molecules and can therefore be transferred more easily.

Electric charge can be transferred in several manners. One of the simplest ways to transfer charge is charging by contact, in which the surfaces of two objects made of different materials are placed in close contact. If one of the materials holds electrons more tightly than the other, then it takes some electrons with it when the materials are separated. Rubbing two surfaces together increases the transfer of electrons, because it creates a closer contact between the materials. It also serves to present fresh material with a full supply of electrons to the other material. Thus, when you walk across a carpet on a dry day, your shoes rub against the carpet, and some electrons are removed from the carpet by your shoes. The result is that you have an excess of negative charge on your shoes. When you then touch a doorknob, some of your excess of electrons transfer to the neutral doorknob, creating a small spark.When you then touch a doorknob, some of your excess of electrons transfer to the neutral doorknob, creating a small spark.

Touching the doorknob with your hand demonstrates a second way to transfer electric charge, which is charging by conduction. This transfer happens because like charges repel, and so the excess electrons that you picked up from the carpet want to be as far away from each other as possible. Some of them move to the doorknob, where they will distribute themselves over the outer surface of the metal. Another example of charging by conduction is shown in the top row of Figure 18.10. A metal sphere with 100 excess electrons touches a metal sphere with 50 excess electrons, so 25 electrons from the first sphere transfer to the second sphere. Each sphere finishes with 75 excess electrons.Each sphere finishes with 75 excess electrons.

The same reasoning applies to the transfer of positive charge. However, because positive charge essentially cannot move in solids, it is transferred by moving negative charge in the opposite direction. For example, consider the bottom row of Figure 18.10. The first metal sphere has 100 excess protons and touches a metal sphere with 50 excess protons, so the second sphere transfers 25 electrons to the first sphere. These 25 extra electrons will electrically cancel 25 protons so that the first metal sphere is left with 75 excess protons. This is shown in the bottom row of Figure 18.10. The second metal sphere lost 25 electrons so it has 25 more excess protons, for a total of 75 excess protons. The end result is the same if we consider that the first ball transferred a net positive charge equal to that of 25 protons to the first ball.The end result is the same if we consider that the first ball transferred a net positive charge equal to that of 25 protons to the first ball.

After the transfer, both spheres have 75 excess electrons. In the bottom row, a metal sphere with 100 excess protons receives 25 electrons from a ball with 50 excess protons.

In this discussion, you may wonder how the excess electrons originally got from your shoes to your hand to create the spark when you touched the doorknob. The answer is that no electrons actually traveled from your shoes to your hands. Instead, because like charges repel each other, the excess electrons on your shoe simply pushed away some of the electrons in your feet. The electrons thus dislodged from your feet moved up into your leg and in turn pushed away some electrons in your leg. This process continued through your whole body until a distribution of excess electrons covered the extremities of your body. Thus your head, your hands, the tip of your nose, and so forth all received their doses of excess electrons that had been pushed out of their normal positions. All this was the result of electrons being pushed out of your feet by the excess electrons on your shoes.All this was the result of electrons being pushed out of your feet by the excess electrons on your shoes.

This type of charge separation is called polarization. As soon as the excess electrons leave your shoes (by rubbing off onto the floor or being carried away in humid air), the distribution of electrons in your body returns to normal. Every part of your body is again electrically neutral (i.e., zero excess charge).Every part of your body is again electrically neutral (i.e., zero excess charge).

The phenomenon of polarization is seen in . The child has accumulated excess positive charge by sliding on the slide. This excess charge repels itself and so becomes distributed over the extremities of the child's body, notably in his hair. As a result, the hair stands on end, because the excess negative charge on each strand repels the excess positive charge on neighboring strands.As a result, the hair stands on end, because the excess negative charge on each strand repels the excess positive charge on neighboring strands.

Polarization can be used to charge objects. Consider the two metallic spheres shown in Figure 18.11. The spheres are electrically neutral, so they carry the same amounts of positive and negative charge. In the top picture (Figure 18.11(a)), the two spheres are touching, and the positive and negative charge is evenly distributed over the two spheres. We then approach a glass rod that carries an excess positive charge, which can be done by rubbing the glass rod with silk, as shown in Figure 18.11(b). Because opposite charges attract each other, the negative charge is attracted to the glass rod, leaving an excess positive charge on the opposite side of the right sphere. This is an example of charging by induction, whereby a charge is created by approaching a charged object with a second object to create an unbalanced charge in the second object. If we then separate the two spheres, as shown in Figure 18.11(c), the excess charge is stuck on each sphere. The left sphere now has an excess negative charge, and the right sphere has an excess positive charge. Finally, in the bottom picture, the rod is removed, and the opposite charges attract each other, so they move as close together as they can get.Finally, in the bottom picture, the rod is removed, and the opposite charges attract each other, so they move as close together as they can get.

Van de Graaff generators are devices that are used not only for serious physics research but also for demonstrating the physics of static electricity at science fairs and in classrooms. Because they deliver relatively little electric current, they can be made safe for use in such environments. The first such generator was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 18.12 shows a simplified sketch of a Van de Graaff generator.Figure 18.12 shows a simplified sketch of a Van de Graaff generator.

Van de Graaff generators use smooth and pointed surfaces and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges. In the version shown in Figure 18.12, electrons are "sprayed" from the tips of the lower comb onto a moving belt, which is made of an insulating material like, such as rubber. This technique of charging the belt is akin to charging your shoes with electrons by walking across a carpet. The belt raises the charges up to the upper comb, where they transfer again, akin to your touching the doorknob and transferring your charge to it. Because like charges repel, the excess electrons all rush to the outer surface of the globe, which is made of metal (a conductor). Thus, the comb itself never accumulates too much charge, because any charge it gains is quickly depleted by the charge moving to the outer surface of the globe.Thus, the comb itself never accumulates too much charge, because any charge it gains is quickly depleted by the charge moving to the outer surface of the globe.

Van de Graaff generators are used to demonstrate many interesting effects caused by static electricity. By touching the globe, a person gains excess charge, so his or her hair stands on end, as shown in Figure 18.13. You can also create mini lightning bolts by moving a neutral conductor toward the globe. Another favorite is to pile up aluminum muffin tins on top of the uncharged globe, then turn on the generator. Being made of conducting material, the tins accumulate excess charge. They then repel each other and fly off the globe one by one.

More than 100 years before Thomson and Rutherford discovered the fundamental particles that carry positive and negative electric charges, the French scientist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb mathematically described the force between charged objects. Doing so required careful measurements of forces between charged spheres, for which he built an ingenious device called a torsion balance.Doing so required careful measurements of forces between charged spheres, for which he built an ingenious device called a torsion balance.

This device, shown in Figure 18.15, contains an insulating rod that is hanging by a thread inside a glass-walled enclosure. At one end of the rod is the metallic sphere A. When no charge is on this sphere, it touches sphere B. Coulomb would touch the spheres with a third metallic ball (shown at the bottom of the diagram) that was charged. An unknown amount of charge would distribute evenly between spheres A and B, which would then repel each other, because like charges repel. This force would cause sphere A to rotate away from sphere B, thus twisting the wire until the torsion in the wire balanced the electrical force. Coulomb then turned the knob at the top, which allowed him to rotate the thread, thus bringing sphere A closer to sphere B. He found that bringing sphere $A$ twice as close to sphere $B$ required increasing the torsion by a factor of four. Bringing the sphere three times closer required a ninefold increase in the torsion. From this type of measurement, he deduced that the electrical force between the spheres was inversely proportional to the distance squared between the spheres. In other words,In other words,

An electrical charge distributes itself equally between two conducting spheres of the same size. Knowing this allowed Coulomb to divide an unknown charge in half. Repeating this process would produce a sphere with one quarter of the initial charge, and
so on. Using this technique, he measured the force between spheres A and B when they were charged with different amounts of charge. These measurements led him to deduce that the force was proportional to the charge on each sphere, orThese measurements led him to deduce that the force was proportional to the charge on each sphere, or

This equation is known as Coulomb's law, and it describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The constant of proportionality $k$ is called Coulomb's constant. In SI units, the constant $k$ has the value $k=8.99  10^{9}    / $.In SI units, the constant $k$ has the value $k=8.99  10^{9}    / $.

The direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of the two objects. If the two charges are of opposite signs, Coulomb's law gives a negative result. This means that the force between the particles is attractive. If the two charges have the same signs, Coulomb's law gives a positive result. This means that the force between the particles is repulsive. For example, if both $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are negative or if both are positive, the force between them is repulsive. This is shown in Figure 18.16 (a). If $q_{1}$ is a negative charge and $q_{2}$ is a positive charge (or vice versa), then the charges are different, so the force between them is attractive. This is shown in Figure 18.16(b).This is shown in Figure 18.16(b).

Figure 18.16 The magnitude of the electrostatic force $F$ between point charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by Coulomb's law. Note that Newton's third law (every force exerted creates an equal and opposite force) applies as usual-the force $, 2 on $q_{1}$ is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force $ it exerts on $q_{2}$. (a) Like charges. (b) Unlike charges.(b) Unlike charges.

Note that Coulomb's law applies only to charged objects that are not moving with respect to each other. The law says that the force is proportional to the amount of charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. If we double the charge $q_{1}$, for instance, then the force is doubled. If we double the distance between the objects, then the force between them decreases by a factor of $2^{2}=4$. Although Coulomb's law is true in general, it is easiest to apply to spherical objects or to objects that are much smaller than the distance between the objects (in which case, the objects can be approximated as spheres).w is true in general, it is easiest to apply to spherical objects or to objects that are much smaller than the distance between the objects (in which case, the objects can be approximated as spheres).

Coulomb's law is an example of an inverse-square law, which means the force depends on the square of the denominator. Another inverse-square law is Newton's law of universal gravitation, which is $F=G m_{1} m_{2} / r^{2}$. Although these laws are similar, they differ in two important respects: (i) The gravitational constant $G$ is much, much smaller than $k$Although these laws are similar, they differ in two important respects: (i) The gravitational constant $G$ is much, much smaller than $k$

( $G=6.67  10^{-11}  /   $ ); and (ii) only one type of mass exists, whereas two types of electric charge exist. These two differences explain why gravity is so much weaker than the electrostatic force and why gravity is only attractive, whereas the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive.These two differences explain why gravity is so much weaker than the electrostatic force and why gravity is only attractive, whereas the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive.

Finally, note that Coulomb measured the distance between the spheres from the centers of each sphere. He did not explain this assumption in his original papers, but it turns out to be valid. From outside a uniform spherical distribution of charge, it can be treated as if all the charge were located at the center of the sphere.From outside a uniform spherical distribution of charge, it can be treated as if all the charge were located at the center of the sphere.

Suppose Coulomb measures a force of $20  10^{-6} $ between the two charged spheres when they are separated by $5.0 $. By turning the dial at the top of the torsion balance, he approaches the spheres so that they are separated by $3.0 $. Which force does he measure now?Which force does he measure now?

STRATEGYSTRATEGY

Apply Coulomb's law to the situation before and after the spheres are brought closer together. Although we do not know the charges on the spheres, we do know that they remain the same. We call these unknown but constant charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$. Because these charges appear as a product in Coulomb's law, they form a single unknown. We thus have two equations and two unknowns, which we can solve. The first unknown is the force (which we call $F_{}$ ) when the spheres are $3.0 $ apart, and the second is $q_{1} q_{2}$.The first unknown is the force (which we call $F_{}$ ) when the spheres are $3.0 $ apart, and the second is $q_{1} q_{2}$.

Use the following notation: When the charges are $5.0 $ apart, the force is $F_{}=20  10^{-6} $ and $r_{}=5.0 =0.050 $, where the subscript $i$ means initial. Once the charges are brought closer together, we know $r_{}=3.0 =0.030 $, where the subscript $f$ means final.Once the charges are brought closer together, we know $r_{}=3.0 =0.030 $, where the subscript $f$ means final.

The force acts along the line joining the centers of the spheres. Because the same type of charge is on each sphere, the force is repulsive.Because the same type of charge is on each sphere, the force is repulsive.


As expected, the force between the charges is greater when they are $3.0 $ apart than when they are $5.0 $ apart. Note that although it is a good habit to convert $$ to $$ (because the constant $k$ is in SI units), it is not necessary in this problem, because the distances cancel out.Note that although it is a good habit to convert $$ to $$ (because the constant $k$ is in SI units), it is not necessary in this problem, because the distances cancel out.

STRATEGYSTRATEGY

We know the force and the charge on each ink drop, so we can solve Coulomb's law for the distance $r$ between the ink drops. Do not forget to convert the force into SI units: $F=5.5 =5.5  10^{-3} $.Do not forget to convert the force into SI units: $F=5.5 =5.5  10^{-3} $.

SolutionSolution

The charges in Coulomb's law are $q_{1}=q_{2}=q_{ {inkdrop }}$, so the numerator in Coulomb's law takes the form $q_{1} q_{2}=q_{ {inkdrop }}^{2}$. Inserting this into Coulomb's law and solving for the distance $r$ givesInserting this into Coulomb's law and solving for the distance $r$ gives

You may have heard of a force field in science fiction movies, where such fields apply forces at particular positions in space to keep a villain trapped or to protect a spaceship from enemy fire. The concept of a field is very useful in physics, although it differs somewhat from what you see in movies.The concept of a field is very useful in physics, although it differs somewhat from what you see in movies.

A field is a way of conceptualizing and mapping the force that surrounds any object and acts on another object at a distance without apparent physical connection. For example, the gravitational field surrounding Earth and all other masses represents the gravitational force that would be experienced if another mass were placed at a given point within the field. Michael Faraday, an English physicist of the nineteenth century, proposed the concept of an electric field. If you know the electric field, then you can easily calculate the force (magnitude and direction) applied to any electric charge that you place in the field.If you know the electric field, then you can easily calculate the force (magnitude and direction) applied to any electric charge that you place in the field.

An electric field is generated by electric charge and tells us the force per unit charge at all locations in space around a charge distribution. The charge distribution could be a single point charge; a distribution of charge over, say, a flat plate; or a more complex distribution of charge. The electric field extends into space around the charge distribution. Now consider placing a test charge in the field. A test charge is a positive electric charge whose charge is so small that it does not significantly disturb the charges that create the electric field. The electric field exerts a force on the test charge in a given direction. The force exerted is proportional to the charge of the test charge. For example, if we double the charge of the test charge, the force exerted on it doubles. Mathematically, saying that electric field is the force per unit charge is written asMathematically, saying that electric field is the force per unit charge is written as

If the test charge is removed from the electric field, the electric field still exists. To create a three-dimensional map of the electric field, imagine placing the test charge in various locations in the field. At each location, measure the force on the charge, and use the vector equation $ / q_{ {test }}$ to calculate the electric field. Draw an arrow at each point where you place the test charge to represent the strength and the direction of the electric field. The length of the arrows should be proportional to the strength of the electric field. If you join together these arrows, you obtain lines.

Just drawing the electric field lines in a plane that slices through the charge gives the two-dimensional electric-field maps shown in Figure 18.18. On the left is the electric field created by a positive charge, and on the right is the electric field created by a negative charge.On the left is the electric field created by a positive charge, and on the right is the electric field created by a negative charge.

Notice that the electric field lines point away from the positive charge and toward the negative charge. Thus, a positive test charge placed in the electric field of the positive charge will be repelled. This is consistent with Coulomb's law, which says that like charges repel each other. If we place the positive charge in the electric field of the negative charge, the positive charge is attracted to the negative charge. The opposite is true for negative test charges. Thus, the direction of the electric field lines is consistent with what we find by using Coulomb's law.Thus, the direction of the electric field lines is consistent with what we find by using Coulomb's law.

The equation $E=k|Q| / r^{2}$ says that the electric field gets stronger as we approach the charge that generates it. For example, at $2 $ from the charge $Q(r=2 )$, the electric field is four times stronger than at $4 $ from the charge $(r=4 )$. Looking at $ 18.17}$ and Figure 18.18 again, we see that the electric field lines become denser as we approach the charge that generates it. In fact, the density of the electric field lines is proportional to the strength of the electric field!

The arrows point in the direction that a positive test charge would move. The field lines are denser as you approach the point charge.The field lines are denser as you approach the point charge.

Electric-field maps can be made for several charges or for more complicated charge distributions. The electric field due to multiple charges may be found by adding together the electric field from each individual charge. Because this sum can only be a single number, we know that only a single electric-field line can go through any given point. In other words, electric-field lines cannot cross each other.In other words, electric-field lines cannot cross each other.

Figure 18.19(a) shows a two-dimensional map of the electric field generated by a charge of $+q$ and a nearby charge of $-q$. The three-dimensional version of this map is obtained by rotating this map about the axis that goes through both charges. A positive
test charge placed in this field would experience a force in the direction of the field lines at its location. It would thus be repelled from the positive charge and attracted to the negative charge. Figure 18.19(b) shows the electric field generated by two charges of $-q$. Note how the field lines tend to repel each other and do not overlap. A positive test charge placed in this field would be attracted to both charges. If you are far from these two charges, where far means much farther than the distance between the charges, the electric field looks like the electric field from a single charge of $-2 q$.If you are far from these two charges, where far means much farther than the distance between the charges, the electric field looks like the electric field from a single charge of $-2 q$.

We know the electric field extends out from positive charge and terminates on negative charge. We also know that the number of electric field lines that touch a charge is proportional to the charge. Charge 1 has 12 fields coming out of it. Charge 2 has six field lines going into it. Charge 3 has 12 field lines going into it.Charge 3 has 12 field lines going into it.


The electric-field lines come out of charge 1 , so it is a positive charge. The electric-field lines go into charges 2 and 3 , so they are negative charges.

Because the doorknob is a conductor, the entire charge is distributed on the outside surface of the metal. In addition, because the doorknob is assumed to be perfectly spherical, the charge on the surface is uniformly distributed, so we can treat the doorknob as if all the charge were located at the center of the doorknob. The validity of this simplification will be proved in a later physics course. Now sketch the doorknob, and define your coordinate system. Use $+x$ to indicate the outward direction

Also, the weight of an adult is about $70   9.8  /   700 $, so why don't you feel a force on the protons in your hand as you reach for the doorknob?

As you learned in studying gravity, a mass in a gravitational field has potential energy, which means it has the potential to accelerate and thereby increase its kinetic energy. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. For example, imagine you want to use a stone to pound a nail into a piece of wood. You first lift the stone high above the nail, which increases the potential energy of the stone-Earth system - because Earth is so large, it does not move, so we usually shorten this by saying simply that the potential energy of the stone increases. When you drop the stone, gravity converts the potential energy into kinetic energy. When the stone hits the nail, it does work by pounding the nail into the wood. The gravitational potential energy is the work that a mass can potentially do by virtue of its position in a gravitational field. Potential energy is a very useful concept, because it can be used with conservation of energy to calculate the motion of masses in a gravitational field.Potential energy is a very useful concept, because it can be used with conservation of energy to calculate the motion of masses in a gravitational field.

Electric potential energy works much the same way, but it is based on the electric field instead of the gravitational field. By virtue of its position in an electric field, a charge has an electric potential energy. If the charge is free to move, the force due to the electric field causes it to accelerate, so its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, just like a mass that falls in a gravitational field. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. The electric potential energy is the work that a charge can do by virtue of its position in an electric field.The electric potential energy is the work that a charge can do by virtue of its position in an electric field.

Figure 18.21 On the left, the gravitational field points toward Earth. The higher the ball is in the gravitational field, the higher the potential energy is of the Earth-ball system. On the right, the electric field points toward a negative charge. The farther the positive charge is from the negative charge, the higher the potential energy is of the two-charge system.The farther the positive charge is from the negative charge, the higher the potential energy is of the two-charge system.

Let's use the symbol $U_{G}$ to denote gravitational potential energy. When a mass falls in a gravitational field, its gravitational potential energy decreases. Conservation of energy tells us that the work done by the gravitational field to make the mass accelerate must equal the loss of potential energy of the mass.

where $F$ is the force due to gravity, and $y_{}$ and $y_{}$ are the initial and final positions of the ball, respectively. The negative sign is because gravity points down, which we consider to be the negative direction. For the constant gravitational field near Earth's surface, $F=m g$. The change in gravitational potential energy of the mass isThe change in gravitational potential energy of the mass is

We now apply the same reasoning to a charge in an electric field to find the electric potential energy. The change $ U_{}$ in electric potential energy is the work done by the electric field to move a charge $q$ from an initial position $x_{}$ to a final position $x_{}($ $ U_{} The definition of work does not change, except that now the work is done by the electric field: $W_{ {donebyE-field }}=F} For a charge that falls through a constant electric field $E$, the force applied to the charge by the electric field is $F=q E$.

If the electric field is not constant, then the equation $ U_{}=-q E} is not valid, and deriving the electric potential energy becomes more involved. For example, consider the electric potential energy of an assembly of two point charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ of the same sign that are initially very far apart. We start by placing charge $q_{1}$ at the origin of our coordinate system. This takes no electrical energy, because there is no electric field at the origin (because charge $q_{2}$ is very far away). We then bring charge $q_{2}$ in from very far away to a distance $r$ from the center of charge $q_{1}$. This requires some effort, because the electric field of charge $q_{1}$ applies a repulsive force on charge $q_{2}$. The energy it takes to assemble these two charges can be recuperated if we let them fly apart again. Thus, the charges have potential energy when they are a distance $r$ apart. It turns out that the electric potential energy of a pair of point charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ a distance $r$ apart isIt turns out that the electric potential energy of a pair of point charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ a distance $r$ apart is


U_{ q_{2}}{r}

U_{ q_{2}}{r}


To recap, if charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are free to move, they can accumulate kinetic energy by flying apart, and this kinetic energy can be used to do work. The maximum amount of work the two charges can do (if they fly infinitely far from each other) is given by the equation above.The maximum amount of work the two charges can do (if they fly infinitely far from each other) is given by the equation above.

Notice that if the two charges have opposite signs, then the potential energy is negative. This means that the charges have more potential to do work when they are far apart than when they are at a distance $r$ apart. This makes sense: Opposite charges attract, so the charges can gain more kinetic energy if they attract each other from far away than if they start at only a short distance apart. Thus, they have more potential to do work when they are far apart.

Recall that to find the force applied by a fixed charge $Q$ on any arbitrary test charge $q$, it was convenient to define the electric field, which is the force per unit charge applied by $Q$ on any test charge that we place in its electric field. The same strategy is used here with electric potential energy: We now define the electric potential $V$, which is the electric potential energy per unit charge.The same strategy is used here with electric potential energy: We now define the electric potential $V$, which is the electric potential energy per unit charge.

Normally, the electric potential is simply called the potential or voltage. The units for the potential are J/C, which are given the name $)$ after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745-1827). From the equation $U_{}=k q_{1} q_{2} / r$, the electric potential a distance $r$ from a point charge $q_{1}$ isFrom the equation $U_{}=k q_{1} q_{2} / r$, the electric potential a distance $r$ from a point charge $q_{1}$ is

Note that this equation actually represents a difference in electric potential. However, because the second term is zero, it is normally not written, and we speak of the electric potential instead of the electric potential difference, or we just say the potential difference, or voltage). Below, when we consider the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points not infinitely far apart, we speak of electric potential difference explicitly. Just remember that electric potential and electric potential difference are really the same thing; the former is used just when the electric potential energy is zero in either the initial or final charge configuration. electric potential and electric potential difference are really the same thing; the former is used just when the electric potential energy is zero in either the initial or final charge configuration.

Now consider the electric potential near a group of charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$, and $q_{3}$, as drawn in Figure 18.24. The electric potential is
derived by considering the electric field. Electric fields follow the principle of superposition and can be simply added together, so the electric potential from different charges also add together.

Notice that a positive charge in a region with high potential will experience a force pushing it toward regions of lower potential. In this sense, potential is like pressure for fluids. Imagine a pipe containing fluid, with the fluid at one end of the pipe under high pressure and the fluid at the other end of the pipe under low pressure. If nothing prevents the fluid from flowing, it will flow from the high-pressure end to the low-pressure end. Likewise, a positive charge that is free to move will move from a region with high potential to a region with lower potential.Likewise, a positive charge that is free to move will move from a region with high potential to a region with lower potential.

Many animals generate and/or detect electric fields. This is useful for activities such as hunting, defense, navigation, communication, and mating. Because salt water is a relatively good conductor, electric fish have evolved in all the world's oceans. These fish have intrigued humans since the earliest times. In the nineteenth century, parties were even organized where the main attraction was getting a jolt from an electric fish! Scientists also studied electric fish to learn about electricity. Alessandro Volta based his research that led to batteries in 1799 on electric fish. He even referred to batteries as artificial electric organs, because he saw them as imitations of the electric organs of electric fish.He even referred to batteries as artificial electric organs, because he saw them as imitations of the electric organs of electric fish.

Animals that generate electricity are called electrogenic and those that detect electric fields are called electroreceptive. Most fish that are electrogenic are also electroreceptive. One of the most well-known electric fish is the electric eel (see Figure 18.25), which is both electrogenic and electroreceptive. These fish have three pairs of organs that produce the electric charge: the main organ, Hunter's organ, and Sach's organ. Together, these organs account for more than 8 opercent of the fish's body.Together, these organs account for more than 8 opercent of the fish's body.

Electric eels can produce electric discharges of much greater voltage than what you would get from a standard wall socket. These discharges can stun or even kill their prey. They also use low-intensity discharges to navigate. The electric fields they generate reflect off nearby obstacles or animals and are then detected by electroreceptors in the eel's skin. The three organs that produce electricity contain electrolytes, which are substances that ionize when dissolved in water (or other liquids). An ionized atom or molecule is one that has lost or gained at least one electron, so it carries a net charge. Thus, a liquid solution containing an electrolyte conducts electricity, because the ions in the solution can move if an electric field is applied.Thus, a liquid solution containing an electrolyte conducts electricity, because the ions in the solution can move if an electric field is applied.

To produce large discharges, the main organ is used. It contains approximately 6,000 rows of electroplaques connected in a long chain. Connected this way, the voltage between electroplaques adds up, creating a large final voltage. Each electroplaque consists of a column of cells controlled by an excitor nerve. When triggered by the excitor nerve, the electroplaques allow ionized sodium to flow through them, creating a potential difference between electroplaques. These potentials add up, and a large current can flow through the electrolyte.These potentials add up, and a large current can flow through the electrolyte.

Dentists use X-rays to image their patients' teeth and bones. The X-ray tubes that generate X-rays contain an electron source separated by about $10 $ from a metallic target. The electrons are accelerated from the source to the target by a uniform electric field with a magnitude of about $100  / $, as drawn in Figure 18.26.

Figure 18.26 In an X-ray tube, a large current flows through the electron source, causing electrons to be ejected from the electron source. The ejected electrons are accelerated toward the target by the electric field. When they strike the target, X-rays are produced.When they strike the target, X-rays are produced.


Use the equation $ V=-E} to find the potential difference given a constant electric field. Define the source position as $x_{}=0$ and the target position as $x_{}=10 $. To accelerate the electrons in the positive $x$ direction, the electric field must point in the negative $x$ direction. This way, the force $F=q E$ on the electrons will point in the positive $x$ direction, because both $q$ and $E$ are negative. Thus, $E=-100  10^{3}  / $.Thus, $E=-100  10^{3}  / $.

Solution for (a)Solution for (a)

Using $x_{}=0$ and $x_{}=10 =0.10 $, the equation $ V=-E} tells us that the potential difference between the electron source and the target isUsing $x_{}=0$ and $x_{}=10 =0.10 $, the equation $ V=-E} tells us that the potential difference between the electron source and the target is

 V=-E}  10^{3}  /  -0)=+10 



The potential difference is positive, so the energy per unit positive charge is higher at the target than at the source. This means that free positive charges would fall from the target to the source. However, electrons are negative charges, so they accelerate from the source toward the target, gaining kinetic energy as they go.However, electrons are negative charges, so they accelerate from the source toward the target, gaining kinetic energy as they go.


Apply conservation of energy to find the final kinetic energy of the electrons. In going from the source to the target, the change in electric potential energy plus the change in kinetic energy of the electrons must be zero, so $ U_{E}+ K=0$. The change in electric potential energy for moving through a constant electric field is given by the equationThe change in electric potential energy for moving through a constant electric field is given by the equation

$ U_{}=-q E}$ U_{}=-q E}

where the electric field is $E=-100  10^{3}  / $. Because the electrons start at rest, their initial kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the change in kinetic energy is simply their final kinetic energy, so $ K=K_{}$.Thus, the change in kinetic energy is simply their final kinetic energy, so $ K=K_{}$.


Again $x_{}=0$ and $x_{}=10 =0.10 $. The charge of an electron is $q=-1.602  10^{-19} $. Conservation of energy givesConservation of energy gives

This is a very small energy. However, electrons are very small, so they are easy to accelerate, and this energy is enough to make an electron go extremely fast. You can find their speed by using the definition of kinetic energy, $K= m v^{2}$. The result is that the electrons are moving at more than 100 million miles per hour!The result is that the electrons are moving at more than 100 million miles per hour!



Consider again the doorknob from the example in the previous section. The doorknob is treated as a spherical conductor with a uniform static charge $q_{1}=-1.5 $ on its surface.

The diameter of the doorknob is $5.0 $.


As we did in the previous section, we treat the charge as if it were concentrated at the center of the doorknob. Again, as you will be able to validate in later physics classes, we can make this simplification, because the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface of the spherical object. Make a sketch of the situation and define a coordinate system, as shown in the image below. We use $+x$ to indicate the outward direction perpendicular to the door, with $x=0$ at the center of the doorknob. If the diameter of the doorknob is $5.0 $, its radius is $2.5 $. Thus, the speck of dust $1.0 $ from the surface of the doorknob is a distance $r=2.5 +1.0 =3.5 $ from the center of the doorknob. To solve this problem, use the equation $U_{}=k q_{1} q_{2} / r$.To solve this problem, use the equation $U_{}=k q_{1} q_{2} / r$.

The charge on the doorknob is $q_{1}=-1.5 =-1.5  10^{-9} $, and the charge on the speck of dust is $q_{2}=0.20 =2.0  10^{-10} $. The distance $r=3.5 =0.035 $. Inserting these values into the equation $U_{}=k q_{1} q_{2} / r$ givesInserting these values into the equation $U_{}=k q_{1} q_{2} / r$ gives



U_{E} & = q_{2}}{r}

The energy is negative, which means that the energy will decrease that is, get even more negative as the speck of dust approaches the doorknob. This helps explain why dust accumulates on objects that carry a static charge. However, note that insulators normally collect more static charge than conductors, because any charge that accumulates on insulators cannot move about on the insulator to find a way to escape. They must simply wait to be removed by some passing moist speck of dust or other host.They must simply wait to be removed by some passing moist speck of dust or other host.

Consider again the X-ray tube discussed in the previous sample problem. How can a uniform electric field be produced? A single positive charge produces an electric field that points away from it, as in . This field is not uniform, because the space between the lines increases as you move away from the charge.

We can extend this idea even further and into two dimensions by placing two metallic plates face to face and charging one with positive charge and the other with an equal magnitude of negative charge.

The magnitude of the charge on each plate is the same.The magnitude of the charge on each plate is the same.

Let's think about the work required to charge these plates. Before the plates are connected to the battery, they are neutral—that is, they have zero net charge. Placing the first positive charge on the left plate and the first negative charge on the right plate requires very little work, because the plates are neutral, so no opposing charges are present. Now consider placing a second positive charge on the left plate and a second negative charge on the right plate. Because the first two charges repel the new arrivals, a force must be applied to the two new charges over a distance to put them on the plates. This is the definition of work, which means that, compared with the first pair, more work is required to put the second pair of charges on the plates. To place the third positive and negative charges on the plates requires yet more work, and so on. Where does this work come from? The battery! Its chemical potential energy is converted into the work required to separate the positive and negative charges.Where does this work come from? The battery! Its chemical potential energy is converted into the work required to separate the positive and negative charges.

Although the battery does work, this work remains within the battery-plate system. Therefore, conservation of energy tells us that, if the potential energy of the battery decreases to separate charges, the energy of another part of the system must increase by the same amount. In fact, the energy from the battery is stored in the electric field between the plates. This idea is analogous to considering that the potential energy of a raised hammer is stored in Earth's gravitational field. If the gravitational field were to disappear, the hammer would have no potential energy. Likewise, if no electric field existed between the plates, no energy would be stored between them.Likewise, if no electric field existed between the plates, no energy would be stored between them.

If we now disconnect the plates from the battery, they will hold the energy. We could connect the plates to a lightbulb, for example, and the lightbulb would light up until this energy was used up. These plates thus have the capacity to store energy. For this reason, an arrangement such as this is called a capacitor. A capacitor is an arrangement of objects that, by virtue of their geometry, can store energy an electric field.A capacitor is an arrangement of objects that, by virtue of their geometry, can store energy an electric field.

This means that both $Q$ and $V$ are always positive, so the capacitance is always positive.

The equation $C=Q / V$ makes sense: A parallel-plate capacitor (like the one shown in Figure 18.28) the size of a football field could hold a lot of charge without requiring too much work per unit charge to push the charge into the capacitor. Thus, $Q$ would be large, and $V$ would be small, so the capacitance $C$ would be very large. Squeezing the same charge into a capacitor the size of a fingernail would require much more work, so $V$ would be very large, and the capacitance would be much smaller.Squeezing the same charge into a capacitor the size of a fingernail would require much more work, so $V$ would be very large, and the capacitance would be much smaller.

For a given capacitor, the ratio of the charge stored in the capacitor to the voltage difference between the plates of the capacitor always remains the same.

Before working through some sample problems, let's look at what happens if we put an insulating material between the plates of a capacitor that has been charged and then disconnected from the charging battery, as illustrated in Figure 18.30. Because the material is insulating, the charge cannot move through it from one plate to the other, so the charge $Q$ on the capacitor does not change. An electric field exists between the plates of a charged capacitor, so the insulating material becomes polarized, as shown in the lower part of the figure. An electrically insulating material that becomes polarized in an electric field is called a dielectric.An electrically insulating material that becomes polarized in an electric field is called a dielectric.

Figure 18.30 shows that the negative charge in the molecules in the material shifts to the left, toward the positive charge of the capacitor. This shift is due to the electric field, which applies a force to the left on the electrons in the molecules of the dielectric. The right sides of the molecules are now missing a bit of negative charge, so their net charge is positive.The right sides of the molecules are now missing a bit of negative charge, so their net charge is positive.

The molecules in the dielectric are polarized by the electric field of the capacitor.The molecules in the dielectric are polarized by the electric field of the capacitor.

All electrically insulating materials are dielectrics, but some are better dielectrics than others. A good dielectric is one whose molecules allow their electrons to shift strongly in an electric field. In other words, an electric field pulls their electrons a fair bit away from their atom, but they do not escape completely from their atom (which is why they are insulators).In other words, an electric field pulls their electrons a fair bit away from their atom, but they do not escape completely from their atom (which is why they are insulators).

Figure 18.31 shows a macroscopic view of a dielectric in a charged capacitor. Notice that the electric-field lines in the capacitor with the dielectric are spaced farther apart than the electric-field lines in the capacitor with no dielectric. This means that the electric field in the dielectric is weaker, so it stores less electrical potential energy than the electric field in the capacitor with no dielectric.This means that the electric field in the dielectric is weaker, so it stores less electrical potential energy than the electric field in the capacitor with no dielectric.

Where has this energy gone? In fact, the molecules in the dielectric act like tiny springs, and the energy in the electric field goes into stretching these springs. With the electric field thus weakened, the voltage difference between the two sides of the capacitor is smaller, so it becomes easier to put more charge on the capacitor. Placing a dielectric in a capacitor before charging it therefore allows more charge and potential energy to be stored in the capacitor.

Figure 18.31 The top and bottom capacitors carry the same charge Q. The top capacitor has no dielectric between its plates. The bottom capacitor has a dielectric between its plates. Because some electric-field lines terminate and start on polarization charges in the dielectric, the electric field is less strong in the capacitor. Thus, for the same charge, a capacitor stores less energy when it contains a dielectric.Thus, for the same charge, a capacitor stores less energy when it contains a dielectric.

Humanity has harnessed electricity, the basis of this technology, to improve our quality of life. Whereas the previous chapter concentrated on static electricity and the fundamental force underlying its behavior, the next two chapters will be devoted to electric and magnetic phenomena involving current.

Just as water flows from high to low elevation, electrons that are free to move will travel from a place with low potential to a place with high potential. A battery has two terminals that are at different potentials. If the terminals are connected by a conducting wire, an electric current (charges) will flow, as shown in Figure 19.2. Electrons will then move from the low-potential terminal of the battery (the negative end) through the wire and enter the high-potential terminal of the battery (the positive end).Electrons will then move from the low-potential terminal of the battery (the negative end) through the wire and enter the high-potential terminal of the battery (the positive end).

Electric current is the rate at which electric charge moves. A large current, such as that used to start a truck engine, moves a large amount very quickly, whereas a small current, such as that used to operate a hand-held calculator, moves a small amount of charge more slowly.

Electric current moving through a wire is in many ways similar to water current moving through a pipe. To define the flow of water through a pipe, we can count the water molecules that flow past a given section of the pipe. As shown in Figure 19.3, electric current is very similar. We count the number of electrical charges that flow past a section of a conductor; in this case, a wire.We count the number of electrical charges that flow past a section of a conductor; in this case, a wire.

Note that we assigned a positive charge to the charges in Figure 19.3. Normally, negative charges—electrons—are the mobile charge in wires, as indicated in Figure 19.2. Positive charges are normally stuck in place in solids and cannot move freely. However, because a positive current moving to the right is the same as a negative current of equal magnitude moving to the left, as shown in Figure 19.4, we define conventional current to flow in the direction that a positive charge would flow if it could move. Thus, unless otherwise specified, an electric current is assumed to be composed of positive charges.Thus, unless otherwise specified, an electric current is assumed to be composed of positive charges.

Also note that one Coulomb is a significant amount of electric charge, so $5 $ is a very large current. Most often you will see current on the order of milliamperes (mA).Most often you will see current on the order of milliamperes (mA).

This lab helps students understand how current works. Given that particles confined in a pipe cannot occupy the same space, pushing more particles into one end of the pipe will force the same number of particles out of the opposite end. This creates a current of particles.This creates a current of particles.

Find a straw and dried peas that can move freely in the straw. Place the straw flat on a table and fill the straw with peas. When you push one pea in at one end, a different pea should come out of the other end. This demonstration is a model for
an electric current. Identify the part of the model that represents electrons and the part of the model that represents the supply of electrical energy. For a period of $30 $, count the number of peas you can push through the straw. When finished, calculate the pea current by dividing the number of peas by the time in seconds.When finished, calculate the pea current by dividing the number of peas by the time in seconds.

Note that the flow of peas is based on the peas physically bumping into each other; electrons push each other along due to mutually repulsive electrostatic forces.Note that the flow of peas is based on the peas physically bumping into each other; electrons push each other along due to mutually repulsive electrostatic forces.

The direction of conventional current is the direction that positive charge would flow. Depending on the situation, positive charges, negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, as we have seen, current is carried by electrons, so the negative charges move. In ionic solutions, such as salt water, both positively charged and negatively charged ions move. This is also true in nerve cells. Pure positive currents are relatively rare but do occur. History credits American politician and scientist Benjamin Franklin with describing current as the direction that positive charges flow through a wire. He named the type of charge associated with electrons negative long before they were known to carry current in so many situations.He named the type of charge associated with electrons negative long before they were known to carry current in so many situations.

As electrons move through a metal wire, they encounter obstacles such as other electrons, atoms, impurities, etc. The electrons scatter from these obstacles, as depicted in Figure 19.5. Normally, the electrons lose energy with each interaction. ${ }^{-}$To keep the electrons moving thus requires a force, which is supplied by an electric field. The electric field in a wire points from the end of the wire at the higher potential to the end of the wire at the lower potential. Electrons, carrying a negative charge, move on average (or drift) in the direction opposite the electric field, as shown in Figure 19.5.Electrons, carrying a negative charge, move on average (or drift) in the direction opposite the electric field, as shown in Figure 19.5.

The collisions normally transfer energy to the conductor, so a constant supply of energy is required to maintain a steady current.The collisions normally transfer energy to the conductor, so a constant supply of energy is required to maintain a steady current.

So far, we have discussed current that moves constantly in a single direction. This is called direct current, because the electric charge flows in only one direction. Direct current is often called $D C$ current.Direct current is often called $D C$ current.

Many sources of electrical power, such as the hydroelectric dam shown at the beginning of this chapter, produce alternating current, in which the current direction alternates back and forth. Alternating current is often called $A C$ current. Alternating current moves back and forth at regular time intervals, as shown in Figure 19.6. The alternating current that comes from a normal wall socket does not suddenly switch directions. Rather, it increases smoothly up to a maximum current and then smoothly decreases back to zero. It then grows again, but in the opposite direction until it has reached the same maximum value. After that, it decreases smoothly back to zero, and the cycle starts over again.After that, it decreases smoothly back to zero, and the cycle starts over again.

Devices that use AC include vacuum cleaners, fans, power tools, hair dryers, and countless others. These devices obtain the power they require when you plug them into a wall socket. The wall socket is connected to the power grid that provides an alternating potential (AC potential). When your device is plugged in, the AC potential pushes charges back and forth in the circuit of the device, creating an alternating current.When your device is plugged in, the AC potential pushes charges back and forth in the circuit of the device, creating an alternating current.

Many devices, however, use DC, such as computers, cell phones, flashlights, and cars. One source of DC is a battery, which provides a constant potential (DC potential) between its terminals. With your device connected to a battery, the DC potential pushes charge in one direction through the circuit of your device, creating a DC current. Another way to produce DC current is by using a transformer, which converts AC potential to DC potential. Small transformers that you can plug into a wall socket are used to charge up your laptop, cell phone, or other electronic device. People generally call this a charger or a battery, but it is a transformer that transforms AC voltage into DC voltage. The next time someone asks to borrow your laptop charger, tell them that you don't have a laptop charger, but that they may borrow your converter.The next time someone asks to borrow your laptop charger, tell them that you don't have a laptop charger, but that they may borrow your converter.

As mentioned previously, electrical current in a wire is in many ways similar to water flowing through a pipe. The water current that can flow through a pipe is affected by obstacles in the pipe, such as clogs and narrow sections in the pipe. These obstacles slow down the flow of current through the pipe. Similarly, electrical current in a wire can be slowed down by many factors, including impurities in the metal of the wire or collisions between the charges in the material. These factors create a resistance to the electrical current. Resistance is a description of how much a wire or other electrical component opposes the flow of charge through it. In the 19th century, the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) found experimentally that current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage drop across a current-carrying conductor.In the 19th century, the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) found experimentally that current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage drop across a current-carrying conductor.

The constant of proportionality is the resistance $R$ of the material, which leads to

V=I R(1.3)


This relationship is called Ohm's law. It can be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship, with voltage being the cause and the current being the effect. Ohm's law is an empirical law like that for friction, which means that it is an experimentally observed phenomenon. The units of resistance are volts per ampere, or V/A. We call a V/A an ohm, which is represented by the uppercase Greek letter omega $( Thus,We call a V/A an ohm, which is represented by the uppercase Greek letter omega $( Thus,

}


Ohm's law holds for most materials and at common temperatures. At very low temperatures, resistance may drop to zero (superconductivity). At very high temperatures, the thermal motion of atoms in the material inhibits the flow of electrons, increasing the resistance. The many substances for which Ohm's law holds are called ohmic. Ohmic materials include good conductors like copper, aluminum, and silver, and some poor conductors under certain circumstances. The resistance of ohmic materials remains essentially the same for a wide range of voltage and current.The resistance of ohmic materials remains essentially the same for a wide range of voltage and current.



This video presents Ohm's law and shows a simple electrical circuit. The speaker uses the analogy of pressure to describe how electric potential makes charge move. He refers to electric potential as electric pressure. Another way of thinking about electric potential is to imagine that lots of particles of the same sign are crowded in a small, confined space. Because these charges have the same sign (they are all positive or all negative), each charge repels the others around it. This means that lots of charges are constantly being pushed towards the outside of the space. A complete electric circuit is like opening a door in the small space: Whichever particles are pushed towards the door now have a way to escape. The higher the electric potential, the harder each particle pushes against the others.The higher the electric potential, the harder each particle pushes against the others.

The plot shows that current is proportional to voltage, which is Ohm's law. In Ohm's law ( $V=I R$ ), the constant of proportionality is the resistance $R$. Because the graph shows current as a function of voltage, we have to rearrange Ohm's law in that form: $I=  V$. This shows that the slope of the line of $I$ versus $V$ is $$. Thus, if we find the slope of the line in Figure 19.7, we can calculate the resistance $R$.Thus, if we find the slope of the line in Figure 19.7, we can calculate the resistance $R$.


The slope of the line is the rise divided by the run. Looking at the lower-left square of the grid, we see that the line rises by $1 $ $(0.001 )$ and runs over a voltage of $1 $. Thus, the slope of the line isThus, the slope of the line is

Now that we understand the concept of electric current, let's see what we can do with it. As you are no doubt aware, the modern lifestyle relies heavily on electrical devices. These devices contain ingenious electric circuits, which are complete, closed pathways through which electric current flows. Returning to our water analogy, an electric circuit is to electric charge like a network of pipes is to water: The electric circuit guides electric charge from one point to the next, running the charge through various devices along the way to extract work or information.ge like a network of pipes is to water: The electric circuit guides electric charge from one point to the next, running the charge through various devices along the way to extract work or information.

Electric circuits are made from many materials and cover a huge range of sizes, as shown in Figure 19.8. Computers and cell phones contain electric circuits whose features can be as small as roughly a billionth of a meter (a nanometer, or $10^{-9} $ ). The pathways that guide the current in these devices are made by ultraprecise chemical treatments of silicon or other semiconductors. Large power systems, on the other hand, contain electric circuits whose features are on the scale of meters. These systems carry such large electric currents that their physical dimensions must be relatively large.These systems carry such large electric currents that their physical dimensions must be relatively large.

The pathways that form electric circuits are made from a conducting material, normally a metal in macroscopic circuits. For example, copper wires inside your school building form the electrical circuits that power lighting, projectors, screens, speakers, etc. To represent an electric circuit, we draw circuit diagrams. We use lines and symbols to represent the elements in the circuit. A simple electric circuit diagram is shown on the left side of Figure 19.9. On the right side is an analogous water circuit, which we discuss below.On the right side is an analogous water circuit, which we discuss below.

Figure 19.9 On the left is a circuit diagram showing a battery (in red), a resistor (black zigzag element), and the current $I$. On the right is the analogous water circuit. The pump is like the battery, the sand filter is like the resistor, the water current is like the electrical current, and the reservoir is like the ground.The pump is like the battery, the sand filter is like the resistor, the water current is like the electrical current, and the reservoir is like the ground.

There are many different symbols that scientists and engineers use in circuit diagrams, but we will focus on four main symbols: the wire, the battery or voltage source, resistors, and the ground. The thin black lines in the electric circuit diagram represent the pathway that the electric charge must follow. These pathways are assumed to be perfect conductors, so electric charge can move along these pathways without losing any energy. In reality, the wires in circuits are not perfect, but they come close enough for our purposes.In reality, the wires in circuits are not perfect, but they come close enough for our purposes.

The zigzag element labeled $R$ is a resistor, which is a circuit element that provides a known resistance. Macroscopic resistors are often color coded to indicate their resistance, as shown in Figure 19.10.Macroscopic resistors are often color coded to indicate their resistance, as shown in Figure 19.10.

Note that the battery icon is not always colored red; this is done in Figure 19.9 just to make it easy to identify.Note that the battery icon is not always colored red; this is done in Figure 19.9 just to make it easy to identify.

Finally, the element labeled ground on the lower left of the circuit indicates that the circuit is connected to Earth, which is a large, essentially neutral object containing an infinite amount of charge. Among other things, the ground determines the potential of the negative terminal of the battery. Normally, the potential of the ground is defined to be zero: $V_{ {ground }}  0$. This
means that the entire lower wire in Figure 19.10 is at a voltage of zero volts.This

The electric current in Figure 19.9 is indicted by the blue line labeled $I$. The arrow indicates the direction in which positive charge would flow in this circuit. Recall that, in metals, electrons are mobile charge carriers, so negative charges actually flow in the opposite direction around this circuit (i.e., counterclockwise). However, we draw the current to show the direction in which positive charge would move.However, we draw the current to show the direction in which positive charge would move.

On the right side of Figure 19.9 is an analogous water circuit. Water at a higher pressure leaves the top of the pump, which is like charges leaving the positive terminal of the battery. The water travels through the pipe, like the charges traveling through the wire. Next, the water goes through a sand filter, which heats up as the water squeezes through. This step is like the charges going through the resistor. When charges flow through a resistor, they do work to heat up the resistor. After flowing through the sand filter, the water has converted its potential energy into heat, so it is at a lower pressure. Likewise, the charges exiting the resistor have converted their potential energy into heat, so they are at a lower voltage. Recall that voltage is just potential energy per charge. Thus, water pressure is analogous to electric potential energy (i.e., voltage). Coming back to the water circuit again, we see that the water returns to the bottom of the pump, which is like the charge returning to the negative terminal of the battery. The water pump uses a source of energy to pump the water back up to a high pressure again, giving it the pressure required to go through the circuit once more. The water pump is like the battery, which uses chemical energy to increase the voltage of the charge up to the level of the positive terminal.The water pump is like the battery, which uses chemical energy to increase the voltage of the charge up to the level of the positive terminal.

The potential energy per charge at the positive terminal of the battery is the voltage rating of the battery. This voltage is like water pressure in the upper pipe. Just like a higher pressure forces water to move toward a lower pressure, a higher voltage forces electric charge to flow toward a lower voltage. The pump takes water at low pressure and does work on it, ejecting water at a higher pressure. Likewise, a battery takes charge at a low voltage, does work on it, and ejects charge at a higher voltage.Likewise, a battery takes charge at a low voltage, does work on it, and ejects charge at a higher voltage.

Note that the current in the water circuit of Figure 19.9 is the same throughout the circuit. In other words, if we measured the number of water molecules passing a cross-section of the pipe per unit time at any point in the circuit, we would get the same answer no matter where in the circuit we measured. The same is true of the electrical circuit in the same figure. The electric current is the same at all points in this circuit, including inside the battery and in the resistor. The electric current neither speeds up in the wires nor slows down in the resistor. This would create points where too much or too little charge would be bunched up. Thus, the current is the same at all points in the circuit shown in Figure 19.9.Thus, the current is the same at all points in the circuit shown in Figure 19.9.

Although the current is the same everywhere in both the electric and water circuits, the voltage or water pressure changes as you move through the circuits. In the water circuit, the water pressure at the pump outlet stays the same until the water goes through the sand filter, assuming no energy loss in the pipe. Likewise, the voltage in the electrical circuit is the same at all points in a given wire, because we have assumed that the wires are perfect conductors. Thus, as indicated by the constant red color of the upper wire in Figure 19.11, the voltage throughout this wire is constant at $V=V_{ {battery }}$. The voltage then drops as you go through the resistor, but once you reach the blue wire, the voltage stays at its new level of $V=0$ all the way to the negative terminal of the battery (i.e., the blue terminal of the battery).you go through the resistor, but once you reach the blue wire, the voltage stays at its new level of $V=0$ all the way to the negative terminal of the battery (i.e., the blue terminal of the battery).

If we go from the blue wire through the battery to the red wire, the voltage increases from $V=0$ to $V=V_{ {battery }}$. Likewise, if we go from the blue wire up through the resistor to the red wire, the voltage also goes from $V=0$ to $V=V_{ {battery }}$.

$V_{ {resistor }}=V_{ {battery }}=I R$.$V_{ {resistor }}=V_{ {battery }}=I R$.

Note that $V_{ {resistor }}$ is measured from the bottom of the resistor to the top, meaning that the top of the resistor is at a higher voltage than the bottom of the resistor. Thus, current flows from the top of the resistor or higher voltage to the bottom of the resistor or lower voltage.Thus, current flows from the top of the resistor or higher voltage to the bottom of the resistor or lower voltage.

The simulation shows how electrons react to these changes. It also shows the atomic cores in the resistor and how they are excited and heat up as more current goes through the resistor.It also shows the atomic cores in the resistor and how they are excited and heat up as more current goes through the resistor.

Other possible circuit elements include capacitors and switches. These are drawn as shown on the left side of Figure 19.12. A switch is a device that opens and closes the circuit, like a light switch. It is analogous to a valve in a water circuit, as shown on the right side of Figure 19.12. With the switch open, no current passes through the circuit. With the switch closed, it becomes part of the wire, so the current passes through it with no loss of voltage.With the switch closed, it becomes part of the wire, so the current passes through it with no loss of voltage.

The capacitor is labeled $$ on the left of Figure 19.12. A capacitor in an electrical circuit is analogous to a flexible membrane in a
water circuit. When the switch is closed in the circuit of Figure 19.12, the battery forces electrical current to flow toward the capacitor, charging the upper capacitor plate with positive charge. As this happens, the voltage across the capacitor plates increases. This is like the membrane in the water circuit: When the valve is opened, the pump forces water to flow toward the membrane, making it stretch to store the excess water. As this happens, the pressure behind the membrane increases.As this happens, the pressure behind the membrane increases.

Now if we open the switch, the capacitor holds the voltage between its plates because the charges have nowhere to go. Likewise, if we close the valve, the water has nowhere to go and the membrane maintains the water pressure in the pipe between itself and the valve.Likewise, if we close the valve, the water has nowhere to go and the membrane maintains the water pressure in the pipe between itself and the valve.

If the switch is closed for a long time in the electric circuit or if the valve is open for a long time in the water circuit, the current will eventually stop flowing because the capacitor or the membrane will have become completely charged. Each circuit is now in the steady state, which means that its characteristics do not change over time. In this case, the steady state is characterized by zero current, and this does not change as long as the switch or valve remains in the same position. In the steady state, no electrical current passes through the capacitor, and no water current passes through the membrane. The voltage difference between the capacitor plates will be the same as the battery voltage. In the water circuit, the pressure behind the membrane will be the same as the pressure created by the pump.In the water circuit, the pressure behind the membrane will be the same as the pressure created by the pump.

Although the circuit in Figure 19.12 may seem a bit pointless because all that happens when the switch is closed is that the capacitor charges up, it does show the capacitor's ability to store charge. Thus, the capacitor serves as a reservoir for charge. This property of capacitors is used in circuits in many ways. For example, capacitors are used to power circuits while batteries are being charged. In addition, capacitors can serve as filters. To understand this, let's go back to the water analogy. Suppose you have a water hose and are watering your garden. Your friend thinks he's funny, and kinks the hose. While the hose is kinked, you experience no water flow. When he lets go, the water starts flowing again. If he does this really fast, you experience water-no water-water-no water, and that's really no way to water your garden. Now imagine that the hose is filling up a big bucket, and you are watering from the bottom of the bucket. As long as you had water in your bucket to begin with and your friend doesn't kink the water hose for too long, you would be able to water your garden without the interruptions. Your friend kinking the water hose is filtered by the big bucket's supply of water, so it does not impact your ability to water the garden. We can think of the interruptions in the current (be it water or electrical current) as noise. Capacitors act in an analogous way as the water bucket to help filter out the noise. Capacitors have so many uses that it is very rare to find an electronic circuit that does not include some capacitors.Capacitors have so many uses that it is very rare to find an electronic circuit that does not include some capacitors.

Physics is used in a wide variety of fields. One field that requires a very thorough knowledge of physics is electrical engineering.

In working with power companies, you can be responsible for maintaining the power grid that supplies electrical power to large areas. Although much of this work is done from an office, it is common to be called in for overtime duty after storms or other natural events. Many electrical engineers enjoy this part of the job, which requires them to race around the countryside repairing high-voltage transformers and other equipment. However, one of the more unpleasant aspects of this work is to remove the carcasses of unfortunate squirrels or other animals that have wandered into the transformers.However, one of the more unpleasant aspects of this work is to remove the carcasses of unfortunate squirrels or other animals that have wandered into the transformers.

Other careers in electrical engineering can involve designing circuits for cell phones, which requires cramming some 10 billion transistors into an electronic chip the size of your thumbnail. These jobs can involve much work with computer simulations and can also involve fields other than electronics. For example, the 1-m-diameter lenses that are used to make these circuits (as of 2015) are so precise that they are shipped from the manufacture to the chip fabrication plant in temperature-controlled trucks to ensure that they are held within a certain temperature range. If they heat up or cool down too much, they deform ever so slightly, rendering them useless for the ultrahigh precision photolithography required to manufacture these chips.If they heat up or cool down too much, they deform ever so slightly, rendering them useless for the ultrahigh precision photolithography required to manufacture these chips.

In addition to a solid knowledge of physics, electrical engineers must above all be practical. Consider, for example, how one corporation managed to launch some anti-ballistic missiles at the White Sands Missile Test Range in New Mexico in the 1960 . Before launch, the skin of the missile had to be at the same voltage as the rail from which it was launched. The rail was connected to the ground by a large copper wire connected to a stake driven into the sandy earth. The missile, however, was connected by an umbilical cord to the equipment in the control shed a few meters away, which was grounded via a different grounding circuit. Before launching the missile, the voltage difference between the missile skin and the rail had to be less than 2.5 V. After an especially dry spell of weather, the missile could not be launched because the voltage difference stood at $5 $. A group of electrical engineers, including the father of your author, stood around pondering how to reduce the voltage difference. The situation was resolved when one of the engineers realized that urine contains electrolytes and conducts electricity quite well. With that, the four engineers quickly resolved the problem by urinating on the rail spike. The voltage difference immediately dropped to below $2.5 $ and the missile was launched on schedule.The voltage difference immediately dropped to below $2.5 $ and the missile was launched on schedule.

Now that we have a basic idea of how electrical circuits work, let's see what happens in circuits with more than one circuit element. In this section, we look at resistors in series. Components connected in series are connected one after the other in the same branch of a circuit, such as the resistors connected in series on the left side of Figure 19.14.Components connected in series are connected one after the other in the same branch of a circuit, such as the resistors connected in series on the left side of Figure 19.14.

Figure 19.14 On the left is an electric circuit with three resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$ connected in series. On the right is an electric circuit with one resistor $R_{ {equiv }}$ that is equivalent to the combination of the three resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$.On the right is an electric circuit with one resistor $R_{ {equiv }}$ that is equivalent to the combination of the three resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$.

We will now try to find a single resistance that is equivalent to the three resistors in series on the left side of Figure 19.14. An equivalent resistor is a resistor that has the same resistance as the combined resistance of a set of other resistors. In other words, the same current will flow through the left and right circuits in Figure 19.14 if we use the equivalent resistor in the right circuit.In other words, the same current will flow through the left and right circuits in Figure 19.14 if we use the equivalent resistor in the right circuit.

According to Ohm's law, the voltage drop $V$ across a resistor when a current flows through it is $V=I R$ where $I$ is the current in amperes (A) and $R$ is the resistance in ohms $( Another way to think of this is that $V$ is the voltage necessary to make a current $I$ flow through a resistance $R$. Applying Ohm's law to each resistor on the left circuit of Figure 19.14, we find that the voltage drop across $R_{1}$ is $V_{1}=I R_{1}$, that across $R_{2}$ is $V_{2}=I R_{2}$, and that across $R_{3}$ is $V_{3}=I R_{3}$. The sum of these voltages equals the voltage output of the battery, that isThe sum of these voltages equals the voltage output of the battery, that is


V_{ {battery }}=V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}  {. }

You may wonder why voltages must add up like this. One way to understand this is to go once around the circuit and add up the successive changes in voltage. If you do this around a loop and get back to the starting point, the total change in voltage should be zero, because you end up at the same place that you started. To better understand this, consider the analogy of going for a stroll through some hilly countryside. If you leave your car and walk around, then come back to your car, the total height you gained in your stroll must be the same as the total height you lost, because you end up at the same place as you started. Thus, the gravitational potential energy you gain must be the same as the gravitational potential energy you lose. The same reasoning holds for voltage in going around an electric circuit. Let's apply this reasoning to the left circuit in Figure 19.14. We start just below the battery and move up through the battery, which contributes a voltage gain of $V_{ {battery }}$. Next, we got through the resistors. The voltage drops by $V_{1}$ in going through resistor $R_{1}$, by $V_{2}$ in going through resistor $R_{2}$, and by $V_{3}$ in going through
resistor $R_{3}$. After going through resistor $R_{3}$, we arrive back at the starting point, so we add up these four changes in voltage and set the sum equal to zero. This givesThis gives


0=V_{ {battery }}-V_{1}-V_{2}-V_{3}

0=V_{ {battery }}-V_{1}-V_{2}-V_{3}


which is the same as the previous equation. Note that the minus signs in front of $V_{1}, V_{2}$, and $V_{3}$ are because these are voltage drops, whereas $V_{ {battery }}$ is a voltage rise.Note that the minus signs in front of $V_{1}, V_{2}$, and $V_{3}$ are because these are voltage drops, whereas $V_{ {battery }}$ is a voltage rise.

Ohm's law tells us that $V_{1}=I R_{1}, V_{2}=I R_{2}$, and $V_{3}=I R_{3}$. Inserting these values into equation $V_{ {battery }}=V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}$ givesInserting these values into equation $V_{ {battery }}=V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}$ gives

In the previous section, we learned that resistors in series are resistors that are connected one after the other. If we instead combine resistors by connecting them next to each other, as shown in Figure 19.16, then the resistors are said to be connected in parallel. Resistors are in parallel when both ends of each resistor are connected directly together.Resistors are in parallel when both ends of each resistor are connected directly together.

Note that the tops of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the top of the each resistor is the same. Likewise, the bottoms of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the bottom of each resistor is the same. This means that the voltage drop across each resistor is the same. In this case, the voltage drop is the voltage rating $V$ of the battery, because the top and bottom wires connect to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively.In this case, the voltage drop is the voltage rating $V$ of the battery, because the top and bottom wires connect to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively.

Although the voltage drop across each resistor is the same, we cannot say the same for the current running through each resistor. Thus, $I_{1}, I_{2}$, and $I_{3}$ are not necessarily the same, because the resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$ do not necessarily have the same
resistance.Thus, $I_{1}, I_{2}$, and $I_{3}$ are not necessarily the same, because the resistors $R_{1}, R_{2}$, and $R_{3}$ do not necessarily have the same
resistance.

Note that the three resistors in Figure 19.16 provide three different paths through which the current can flow. This means that the equivalent resistance for these three resistors must be less than the smallest of the three resistors. To understand this, imagine that the smallest resistor is the only path through which the current can flow. Now add on the alternate paths by connecting other resistors in parallel. Because the current has more paths to go through, the overall resistance (i.e., the equivalent resistance) will decrease. Therefore, the equivalent resistance must be less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors.Therefore, the equivalent resistance must be less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors.

Although 0.62 A flows through the entire circuit, note that this current does not flow through each resistor. However, because
electric charge must be conserved in a circuit, the sum of the currents going through each branch of the circuit must add up to the current going through the battery. In other words, we cannot magically create charge somewhere in the circuit and add this new charge to the current.

Thus, it is three times easier for the current to flow through these resistors than to flow through a single one of them.Thus, it is three times easier for the current to flow through these resistors than to flow through a single one of them.

Figure 19.18 shows just a few of the multitude of different forms robots can take. The most advanced humanoid robots can walk, pour drinks, even dance (albeit not very gracefully). Other robots are bio-inspired, such as the dogbot shown in the middle photograph of Figure 19.18. This robot can carry hundreds of pounds of load over rough terrain. The photograph on the right in Figure 19.18 shows the inner workings of an $M$-block, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These simplelooking blocks contain inertial wheels and electromagnets that allow them to spin and flip into the air and snap together in a variety of shapes. By communicating wirelessly between themselves, they self-assemble into a variety of shapes, such as desks, chairs, and someday maybe even buildings.By communicating wirelessly between themselves, they self-assemble into a variety of shapes, such as desks, chairs, and someday maybe even buildings.

All robots involve an immense amount of physics and engineering. The simple act of pouring a drink has only recently been mastered by robots, after over 30 years of research and development! The balance and timing that we humans take for granted is in fact a very tricky act to follow, requiring excellent balance, dexterity, and feedback. To master this requires sensors to detect balance, computing power to analyze the data and communicate the appropriate compensating actions, and joints and actuators to implement the required actions.To master this requires sensors to detect balance, computing power to analyze the data and communicate the appropriate compensating actions, and joints and actuators to implement the required actions.

In addition to sensing gravity or acceleration, robots can contain multiple different sensors to detect light, sound, temperature, smell, taste, etc. These devices are all based on the physical principles that you are studying in this text. For example, the optics used for robotic vision are similar to those used in your digital cameras: pixelated semiconducting detectors in which light is
converted into electrical signals. To detect temperature, simple thermistors may be used, which are resistors whose resistance changes depending on temperature.To detect temperature, simple thermistors may be used, which are resistors whose resistance changes depending on temperature.

Building a robot today is much less arduous than it was a few years ago. Numerous companies now offer kits for building robots. These range in complexity something suitable for elementary school children to something that would challenge the best professional engineers. If interested, you may find these easily on the Internet and start making your own robot today.If interested, you may find these easily on the Internet and start making your own robot today.

Power is associated by many people with electricity. Every day, we use electric power to run our modern appliances. Electric power transmission lines are visible examples of electricity providing power. We also use electric power to start our cars, to run our computers, or to light our homes. Power is the rate at which energy of any type is transferred; electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred in a circuit. In this section, we'll learn not only what this means, but also what factors determine electric power.In this section, we'll learn not only what this means, but also what factors determine electric power.

To get started, let's think of light bulbs, which are often characterized in terms of their power ratings in watts. Let us compare a 25 -W bulb with a 60 -W bulb (see Figure 19.20). Although both operate at the same voltage, the 60 -W bulb emits more light intensity than the $25-$ bulb. This tells us that something other than voltage determines the power output of an electric circuit.This tells us that something other than voltage determines the power output of an electric circuit.

Incandescent light bulbs, such as the two shown in Figure 19.20, are essentially resistors that heat up when current flows through them and they get so hot that they emit visible and invisible light. Thus the two light bulbs in the photo can be considered as two different resistors. In a simple circuit such as a light bulb with a voltage applied to it, the resistance determines the current by Ohm's law, so we can see that current as well as voltage must determine the power.

But a Coulomb per second (C/s) is an electric current, which we can see from the definition of electric current, $I={ t}$, where $ $Q$ is the charge in coulombs and $ t$ is time in seconds. Thus, equation above tells us that electric power is voltage times current, orThus, equation above tells us that electric power is voltage times current, or

This equation gives the electric power consumed by a circuit with a voltage drop of $V$ and a current of $I$.This equation gives the electric power consumed by a circuit with a voltage drop of $V$ and a current of $I$.

In calculating the power in the circuit of Figure 19.21, we used the resistance and Ohm's law to find the current. Ohm's law gives the current: $I=V / R$, which we can insert into the equation for electric power to obtainOhm's law gives the current: $I=V / R$, which we can insert into the equation for electric power to obtain

This gives the power in terms of only the voltage and the resistance.This gives the power in terms of only the voltage and the resistance.

We can also use Ohm's law to eliminate the voltage in the equation for electric power and obtain an expression for power in terms of just the current and the resistance. If we write Ohm's law as $V=I R$ and use this to eliminate $V$ in the equation $P=I V$, we obtainIf we write Ohm's law as $V=I R$ and use this to eliminate $V$ in the equation $P=I V$, we obtain


P=I V=I(I R)=I^{2} R

P=I V=I(I R)=I^{2} R


This gives the power in terms of only the current and the resistance.This gives the power in terms of only the current and the resistance.

Thus, by combining Ohm's law with the equation $P=I V$ for electric power, we obtain two more expressions for power: one in terms of voltage and resistance and one in terms of current and resistance. Note that only resistance (not capacitance or anything else), current, and voltage enter into the expressions for electric power. This means that the physical characteristic of a circuit that determines how much power it dissipates is its resistance. Any capacitors in the circuit do not dissipate electric power-on the contrary, capacitors either store electric energy or release electric energy back to the circuit.Any capacitors in the circuit do not dissipate electric power-on the contrary, capacitors either store electric energy or release electric energy back to the circuit.

INTRODUCTION You may have encountered magnets for the first time as a small child playing with magnetic toys or refrigerator magnets. At the time, you likely noticed that two magnets that repulse each other will attract each other if you flip one of them around. The force that acts across the air gaps between magnets is the same force that creates wonders such as the Aurora Borealis. In fact, magnetic effects pervade our lives in myriad ways, from electric motors to medical imaging and computer memory. In this chapter, we introduce magnets and learn how they work and how magnetic fields and electric currents interact.In this chapter, we introduce magnets and learn how they work and how magnetic fields and electric currents interact.

People have been aware of magnets and magnetism for thousands of years. The earliest records date back to ancient times, particularly in the region of Asia Minor called Magnesia-the name of this region is the source of words like magnet. Magnetic rocks found in Magnesia, which is now part of western Turkey, stimulated interest during ancient times. When humans first discovered magnetic rocks, they likely found that certain parts of these rocks attracted bits of iron or other magnetic rocks more strongly than other parts. These areas are called the poles of a magnet. A magnetic pole is the part of a magnet that exerts the strongest force on other magnets or magnetic material, such as iron. For example, the poles of the bar magnet shown in Figure 20.2 are where the paper clips are concentrated.For example, the poles of the bar magnet shown in Figure 20.2 are where the paper clips are concentrated.

If a bar magnet is suspended so that it rotates freely, one pole of the magnet will always turn toward the north, with the opposite pole facing south. This discovery led to the compass, which is simply a small, elongated magnet mounted so that it can rotate freely. An example of a compass is shown Figure 20.3. The pole of the magnet that orients northward is called the north pole, and the opposite pole of the magnet is called the south pole.The pole of the magnet that orients northward is called the north pole, and the opposite pole of the magnet is called the south pole.

Figure 20.3 A compass is an elongated magnet mounted in a device that allows the magnet to rotate freely.Figure 20.3 A compass is an elongated magnet mounted in a device that allows the magnet to rotate freely.

The discovery that one particular pole of a magnet orients northward, whereas the other pole orients southward allowed people to identify the north and south poles of any magnet. It was then noticed that the north poles of two different magnets repel each other, and likewise for the south poles. Conversely, the north pole of one magnet attracts the south pole of other magnets. This situation is analogous to that of electric charge, where like charges repel and unlike charges attract. In magnets, we simply replace charge with pole: Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. This is summarized in Figure 20.4, which shows how the force between magnets depends on their relative orientation.This is summarized in Figure 20.4, which shows how the force between magnets depends on their relative orientation.

Figure 20.4 Depending on their relative orientation, magnet poles will either attract each other or repel each other.Figure 20.4 Depending on their relative orientation, magnet poles will either attract each other or repel each other.

Consider again the fact that the pole of a magnet that orients northward is called the north pole of the magnet. If unlike poles attract, then the magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic North Pole must be a magnetic south pole! Likewise, the magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic South Pole must be a magnetic north pole. This situation is depicted in Figure 20.5, in which Earth is represented as containing a giant internal bar magnet with its magnetic south pole at the geographic North Pole and vice versa. If we were to somehow suspend a giant bar magnet in space near Earth, then the north pole of the space magnet would be attracted to the south pole of Earth's internal magnet. This is in essence what happens with a compass needle: Its magnetic north pole is attracted to the magnet south pole of Earth's internal magnet.This is in essence what happens with a compass needle: Its magnetic north pole is attracted to the magnet south pole of Earth's internal magnet.

Figure 20.5 Earth can be thought of as containing a giant magnet running through its core. The magnetic south pole of Earth's magnet is at the geographic North Pole, so the north pole of magnets is attracted to the North Pole, which is how the north pole of magnets got their name. Likewise, the south pole of magnets is attracted to the geographic South Pole of Earth.Likewise, the south pole of magnets is attracted to the geographic South Pole of Earth.

What happens if you cut a bar magnet in half? Do you obtain one magnet with two south poles and one magnet with two north poles? The answer is no: Each half of the bar magnet has a north pole and a south pole. You can even continue cutting each piece of the bar magnet in half, and you will always obtain a new, smaller magnet with two opposite poles. As shown in Figure 20.6, you can continue this process down to the atomic scale, and you will find that even the smallest particles that behave as magnets have two opposite poles. In fact, no experiment has ever found any object with a single magnetic pole, from the smallest subatomic particle such as electrons to the largest objects in the universe such as stars. Because magnets always have two poles, they are referred to as magnetic dipoles-di means two. Below, we will see that magnetic dipoles have properties that are analogous to electric dipoles.Below, we will see that magnetic dipoles have properties that are analogous to electric dipoles.

Only certain materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium, exhibit strong magnetic effects. Such materials are called ferromagnetic, after the Latin word ferrum for iron. Other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects, which are detectable only with sensitive instruments. Not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets-the way iron is attracted to magnets-but they can also be magnetized themselves - that is, they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent magnets (Figure 20.7). A permanent magnet is simply a material that retains its magnetic behavior for a long time, even when exposed to demagnetizing influences.A permanent magnet is simply a material that retains its magnetic behavior for a long time, even when exposed to demagnetizing influences.

The iron becomes a permanent magnet with the poles aligned as shown: Its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original magnet, and its north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original magnet. Note that attractive forces are created between the central magnet and the outer magnets.Note that attractive forces are created between the central magnet and the outer magnets.

When a magnet is brought near a previously unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, it causes local magnetization of the material with unlike poles closest, as in the right side of Figure 20.7.

What happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in Figure 7(a). Regions within the material called domains act like small bar magnets. Within domains, the magnetic poles of individual atoms are aligned. Each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Domains are small and randomly oriented in an unmagnetized ferromagnetic object. In response to an external magnetic field, the domains may grow to millimeter size, aligning themselves, as shown in Figure $7()$. This induced magnetization can be made permanent if the material is heated and then cooled, or simply tapped in the presence of other magnets.This induced magnetization can be made permanent if the material is heated and then cooled, or simply tapped in the presence of other magnets.

Conversely, a permanent magnet can be demagnetized by hard blows or by heating it in the absence of another magnet. Increased thermal motion at higher temperature can disrupt and randomize the orientation and size of the domains. There is a well-defined temperature for ferromagnetic materials, which is called the Curie temperature, above which they cannot be magnetized. The Curie temperature for iron is $1,043   which is well above room temperature. There are several elements and alloys that have Curie temperatures much lower than room temperature and are ferromagnetic only below those temperatures.There are several elements and alloys that have Curie temperatures much lower than room temperature and are ferromagnetic only below those temperatures.

We have thus seen that forces can be applied between magnets and between magnets and ferromagnetic materials without any contact between the objects. This is reminiscent of electric forces, which also act over distances. Electric forces are described using the concept of the electric field, which is a force field around electric charges that describes the force on any other charge placed in the field. Likewise, a magnet creates a magnetic field around it that describes the force exerted on other magnets placed in the field. As with electric fields, the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful for visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field.As with electric fields, the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful for visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field.

As shown in Figure 20.9, the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north pole of a compass needle points. If you place a compass near the north pole of a magnet, the north pole of the compass needle will be repelled and point away from the magnet. Thus, the magnetic field lines point away from the north pole of a magnet and toward its south pole.

Magnetic field lines can be mapped out using a small compass. The compass is moved from point to point around a magnet, and at each point, a short line is drawn in the direction of the needle, as shown in Figure 20.10. Joining the lines together then reveals the path of the magnetic field line. Another way to visualize magnetic field lines is to sprinkle iron filings around a magnet. The filings will orient themselves along the magnetic field lines, forming a pattern such as that shown on the right in Figure 20.10.The filings will orient themselves along the magnetic field lines, forming a pattern such as that shown on the right in Figure 20.10.

When two magnets are brought close together, the magnetic field lines are perturbed, just as happens for electric field lines when two electric charges are brought together. Bringing two north poles together-or two south poles-will cause a repulsion, and the magnetic field lines will bend away from each other. This is shown in Figure 20.11, which shows the magnetic field lines created by the two closely separated north poles of a bar magnet. When opposite poles of two magnets are brought together, the
magnetic field lines join together and become denser between the poles. This situation is shown in Figure 20.11.This situation is shown in Figure 20.11.

Figure 20.11 (a) When two north poles are approached together, the magnetic field lines repel each other and the two magnets experience a repulsive force. The same occurs if two south poles are approached together. (b) If opposite poles are approached together, the magnetic field lines become denser between the poles and the magnets experience an attractive force.(b) If opposite poles are approached together, the magnetic field lines become denser between the poles and the magnets experience an attractive force.

Like the electric field, the magnetic field is stronger where the lines are denser. Thus, between the two north poles in Figure 20.11, the magnetic field is very weak because the density of the magnetic field is almost zero. A compass placed at that point would essentially spin freely if we ignore Earth's magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field lines between the north and south poles in Figure 20.11 are very dense, indicating that the magnetic field is very strong in this region. A compass placed here would quickly align with the magnetic field and point toward the south pole on the right.A compass placed here would quickly align with the magnetic field and point toward the south pole on the right.

Note that magnets are not the only things that make magnetic fields. Early in the nineteenth century, people discovered that electrical currents cause magnetic effects. The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence that the movement of electric charges had any connection with magnets. An electromagnet is a device that uses electric current to make a magnetic field. These temporarily induced magnets are called electromagnets. Electromagnets are employed for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90 -km-circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical-imaging machines (see Figure 20.12).for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90 -km-circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical-imaging machines (see Figure 20.12).

The magnetic field created by an electric current in a long straight wire is shown in Figure 20.13. The magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. This rule shows up in several places in the study of electricity and magnetism.

Now imagine winding a wire around a cylinder with the cylinder then removed. The result is a wire coil, as shown in Figure 20.14. This is called a solenoid. To find the direction of the magnetic field produced by a solenoid, apply the right-hand rule to several points on the coil. You should be able to convince yourself that, inside the coil, the magnetic field points from left to right. In fact, another application of the right-hand rule is to curl your right-hand fingers around the coil in the direction in which the current flows.

If a moving electric charge, that is electric current, produces a magnetic field that can exert a force on another magnet, then the reverse should be true by Newton's third law. In other words, a charge moving through the magnetic field produced by another object should experience a force-and this is exactly what we find. As a concrete example, consider Figure 20.16, which shows a
charge $q$ moving with velocity $$ through a magnetic field $$ between the poles of a permanent magnet. The magnitude $F$ of the force experienced by this charge isThe magnitude $F$ of the force experienced by this charge is

In Tom Clancy's Cold War novel "The Hunt for Red October," the Soviet Union built a submarine (see Figure 20.17) with a magnetohydrodynamic drive that was so silent it could not be detected by surface ships. The only conceivable purpose to build such a submarine was to give the Soviet Union first-strike capability, because this submarine could sneak close to the coast of the United States and fire its ballistic missiles, destroying key military and government installations to prevent an American counterattack., because this submarine could sneak close to the coast of the United States and fire its ballistic missiles, destroying key military and government installations to prevent an American counterattack.

A magnetohydrodynamic drive is supposed to be silent because it has no moving parts. Instead, it uses the force experienced by charged particles that move in a magnetic field. The basic idea behind such a drive is depicted in Figure 20.18. Salt water flows through a channel that runs from the front to the back of the submarine. A magnetic field is applied horizontally across the channel, and a voltage is applied across the electrodes on the top and bottom of the channel to force a downward electric current through the water. The charge carriers are the positive sodium ions and the negative chlorine ions of salt. Using the right-hand
rule, the force on the charge carriers is found to be toward the rear of the vessel. The accelerated charges collide with water molecules and transfer their momentum, creating a jet of water that is propelled out the rear of the channel. By Newton's third law, the vessel experiences a force of equal magnitude, but in the opposite direction.By Newton's third law, the vessel experiences a force of equal magnitude, but in the opposite direction.

Fortunately for all involved, it turns out that such a propulsion system is not very practical. Some back-of-the-envelope calculations show that, to power a submarine, either extraordinarily high magnetic fields or extraordinarily high electric currents would be required to obtain a reasonable thrust. In addition, prototypes of magnetohydrodynamic drives show that they are anything but silent. Electrolysis caused by running a current through salt water creates bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen, which makes this propulsion system quite noisy. The system also leaves a trail of chloride ions and metal chlorides that can easily be detected to locate the submarine. Finally, the chloride ions are extremely reactive and very quickly corrode metal parts, such as the electrode or the water channel itself. Thus, the Red October remains in the realm of fiction, but the physics involved is quite real.Thus, the Red October remains in the realm of fiction, but the physics involved is quite real.

Instead of a single charge moving through a magnetic field, consider now a steady current $I$ moving through a straight wire. If we place this wire in a uniform magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.19, what is the force on the wire or, more precisely, on the electrons in the wire? An electric current involves charges that move. If the charges $q$ move a distance $ in a time $t$, then their speed is $v= / t$. Inserting this into the equation $F=q v B   givesInserting this into the equation $F=q v B   gives



F & =q B   
& =  B  



F & =q B   
& =  B  



The factor $q / t$ in this equation is nothing more than the current in the wire. Thus, using $I=q / t$, we obtainThus, using $I=q / t$, we obtain


F=I  B  

F=I  B  


This equation gives the force on a straight current-carrying wire of length $ in a magnetic field of strength $B$. The angle $ is the angle between the current vector and the magnetic field vector.

Throughout this section, you may have noticed the symmetries between magnetic effects and electric effects. These effects all fall under the umbrella of electromagnetism, which is the study of electric and magnetic phenomena. We have seen that electric charges produce electric fields, and moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. A magnetic dipole produces a magnetic field, and, as we will see in the next section, moving magnetic dipoles produce an electric field. Thus, electricity and magnetism are two intimately related and symmetric phenomena.Thus, electricity and magnetism are two intimately related and symmetric phenomena.

This seems like a very small force.

We found that the proton's initial acceleration as it enters the magnetic field is downward in the plane of the page. Notice that, as the proton accelerates, its velocity remains perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the magnitude of the force does not change. In addition, because of the right-hand rule, the direction of the force remains perpendicular to the velocity. This force is nothing more than a centripetal force: It has a constant magnitude and is always perpendicular to the velocity. Thus, the magnitude of the velocity does not change, and the proton executes circular motion. The radius of this circle may be found by using the kinematics relationship.The radius of this circle may be found by using the kinematics relationship.

To find the direction of the force, begin by placing the current vector end to end with a vector for the magnetic field. The result is as shown in the figure in the previous Worked Example with $$ replaced by $$. Curl your right-hand fingers from $$ to $$ and your right thumb points down the page, again as shown in the figure in the previous Worked Example. Thus, the direction of the force is in the $$-direction. The complete force is thus $(0.12 ) $.The complete force is thus $(0.12 ) $.


The direction of the force is the same as the initial direction of the force was in the previous example for a proton. However, because the current in a wire is confined to a wire, the direction in which the charges move does not change. Instead, the entire wire accelerates in the $$-direction.

As we learned previously, a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field experiences a force-recall $F=I  B   Electric motors, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are the most common application of magnetic force on currentcarrying wires. Motors consist of loops of wire in a magnetic field. When current is passed through the loops, the magnetic field exerts a torque on the loops, which rotates a shaft. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical work in the process. Figure 20.23 shows a schematic drawing of an electric motor.Figure 20.23 shows a schematic drawing of an electric motor.

Figure 20.23 Torque on a current loop. A vertical loop of wire in a horizontal magnetic field is attached to a vertical shaft. When current is passed through the wire loop, torque is exerted on it, making it turn the shaft.When current is passed through the wire loop, torque is exerted on it, making it turn the shaft.

Let us examine the force on each segment of the loop in Figure 20.23 to find the torques produced about the axis of the vertical shaft-this will lead to a useful equation for the torque on the loop. We take the magnetic field to be uniform over the rectangular loop, which has width $w$ and height $ as shown in the figure. First, consider the force on the top segment of the loop. To determine the direction of the force, we use the right-hand rule. The current goes from left to right into the page, and the magnetic field goes from left to right in the plane of the page. Curl your right fingers from the current vector to the magnetic field vector and your right thumb points down. Thus, the force on the top segment is downward, which produces no torque on the shaft. Repeating this analysis for the bottom segment-neglect the small gap where the lead wires go out-shows that the force on the bottom segment is upward, again producing no torque on the shaft.Repeating this analysis for the bottom segment-neglect the small gap where the lead wires go out-shows that the force on the bottom segment is upward, again producing no torque on the shaft.

Consider now the left vertical segment of the loop. Again using the right-hand rule, we find that the force exerted on this segment is perpendicular to the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.23. This force produces a torque on the shaft. Repeating this analysis on the right vertical segment of the loop shows that the force on this segment is in the direction opposite that of the force on the left segment, thereby producing an equal torque on the shaft. The total torque on the shaft is thus twice the toque on one of the vertical segments of the loop.The total torque on the shaft is thus twice the toque on one of the vertical segments of the loop.

To find the magnitude of the torque as the wire loop spins, consider Figure 20.24, which shows a view of the wire loop from above. Recall that torque is defined as $ F   where $F$ is the applied force, $r$ is the distance from the pivot to where the force is applied, and $ is the angle between $r$ and $F$. Notice that, as the loop spins, the current in the vertical loop segments is always perpendicular to the magnetic field. Thus, the equation $F=I  B   gives the magnitude of the force on each vertical segment as $F=I  B$. The distance $r$ from the shaft to where this force is applied is $w / 2$, so the torque created by this force isThe distance $r$ from the shaft to where this force is applied is $w / 2$, so the torque created by this force is

If we have a multiple loop with $N$ turns, we get $N$ times the torque of a single loop. Using the fact that the area of the loop is $A=w  the expression for the torque becomesUsing the fact that the area of the loop is $A=w  the expression for the torque becomes

Figure 20.24 View from above of the wire loop from Figure 20.23. The magnetic field generates a force $F$ on each vertical segment of the wire loop, which generates a torque on the shaft.

From the equation $ I A B   we see that the torque is zero when $ As the wire loop rotates, the torque increases to a maximum positive torque of $w  B$ when $$. The torque then decreases back to zero as the wire loop rotates to $$. From $$ to $$, the torque is negative. Thus, the torque changes sign every half turn, so the wire loop will oscillate back and forth.Thus, the torque changes sign every half turn, so the wire loop will oscillate back and forth.

Consider now what happens if we run the motor in reverse; that is, we attach a handle to the shaft and mechanically force the coil to rotate within the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.26. As per the equation $F=q v B   $ is the angle between the vectors $$ and $$ —charges in the wires of the loop experience a magnetic force because they are moving in a magnetic field. Again using the right-hand rule, where we curl our fingers from vector $$ to vector $$, we find that charges in the top and bottom segments feel a force perpendicular to the wire, which does not cause a current. However, charges in the vertical wires experience forces parallel to the wire, causing a current to flow through the wire and through an external circuit if one is connected.

Because current is induced only in the side wires, we can find the induced emf by only considering these wires. As explained in Induced Current in a Wire, motional emf in a straight wire moving at velocity $v$ through a magnetic field $B$ is $E=B  v$, where the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the generator, the velocity makes an angle $ with $B$ (see Figure 20.27), so the velocity component perpendicular to $B$ is $v   Thus, in this case, the emf induced on each vertical wire segment is $E=B  v   and they are in the same direction.

Figure 20.28 shows a generator connected to a light bulb and a graph of the emf vs. time. Note that the emf oscillates from a positive maximum of $E_{0}$ to a negative maximum of $-$. In between, the emf goes through zero, which means that zero current flows through the light bulb at these times. Thus, the light bulb actually flickers on and off at a frequency of $2 f$, because there are two zero crossings per period. Since alternating current such as this is used in homes around the world, why do we not notice the lights flickering on and off? In the United States, the frequency of alternating current is $60 $, so the lights flicker on and off at a frequency of $120 $. This is faster than the refresh rate of the human eye, so you don't notice the flicker of the lights. Also, other factors prevent various different types of light bulbs from switching on and off so fast, so the light output is smoothed out a bit.

Another very useful and common device that exploits magnetic induction is called a transformer. Transformers do what their name implies-they transform voltages from one value to another; the term voltage is used rather than emf because transformers have internal resistance. For example, many cell phones, laptops, video games, power tools, and small appliances have a transformer built into their plug-in unit that changes $120 $ or $240  $ into whatever voltage the device uses. Figure 20.30 shows two different transformers. Notice the wire coils that are visible in each device. The purpose of these coils is explained below.The purpose of these coils is explained below.

Figure 20.31 shows a laminated-coil transformer, which is based on Faraday's law of induction and is very similar in construction to the apparatus Faraday used to demonstrate that magnetic fields can generate electric currents. The two wire coils are called the primary and secondary coils. In normal use, the input voltage is applied across the primary coil, and the secondary produces the transformed output voltage. Not only does the iron core trap the magnetic field created by the primary coil, but also its magnetization increases the field strength, which is analogous to how a dielectric increases the electric field strength in a capacitor. Since the input voltage is AC, a time-varying magnetic flux is sent through the secondary coil, inducing an $$ output voltage.Since the input voltage is AC, a time-varying magnetic flux is sent through the secondary coil, inducing an $$ output voltage.

To send men to the moon, the Apollo program had to design an onboard computer system that would be robust, consume little power, and be small enough to fit onboard the spacecraft.

To address this problem, engineers at MIT and a major defense contractor turned to magnetic rope memory, which was an offshoot of a similar technology used prior to that time for creating random access memories. Unlike random access memory, magnetic rope memory was read-only memory that contained not only data but instructions as well. Thus, it was actually more than memory: It was a hard-wired computer program.Thus, it was actually more than memory: It was a hard-wired computer program.

The components of magnetic rope memory were wires and iron rings-which were called cores. The iron cores served as transformers, such as that shown in the previous figure. However, instead of looping the wires multiple times around the core, individual wires passed only a single time through the cores, making these single-turn transformers. Up to 63 word wires could pass through a single core, along with a single bit wire. If a word wire passed through a given core, a voltage pulse on this wire would induce an emf in the bit wire, which would be interpreted as a one. If the word wire did not pass through the core, no emf would be induced on the bit wire, which would be interpreted as a zero.If the word wire did not pass through the core, no emf would be induced on the bit wire, which would be interpreted as a zero.

Engineers would create programs that would be hard wired into these magnetic rope memories. The wiring process could take as long as a month to complete as workers painstakingly threaded wires through some cores and around others. If any mistakes were made either in the programming or the wiring, debugging would be extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible.If any mistakes were made either in the programming or the wiring, debugging would be extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible.

These modules did their job quite well. They are credited with correcting an astronaut mistake in the lunar landing procedure, thereby allowing Apollo 11 to land on the moon.

For the transformer shown in Figure 20.31, the output voltage $V_{}$ from the secondary coil depends almost entirely on the input voltage $V_{}$ across the primary coil and the number of loops in the primary and secondary coils.

Transformers are widely used in the electric power industry to increase voltages—called step-up transformers—before longdistance transmission via high-voltage wires. They are also used to decrease voltages-called step-down transformers-to deliver power to homes and businesses. The overwhelming majority of electric power is generated by using magnetic induction, whereby a wire coil or copper disk is rotated in a magnetic field. The primary energy required to rotate the coils or disk can be provided by a variety of means. Hydroelectric power plants use the kinetic energy of water to drive electric generators. Coal or nuclear power plants create steam to drive steam turbines that turn the coils. Other sources of primary energy include wind, tides, or waves on water.Other sources of primary energy include wind, tides, or waves on water.

Once power is generated, it must be transmitted to the consumer, which often means transmitting power over hundreds of kilometers. To do this, the voltage of the power plant is increased by a step-up transformer, that is stepped up, and the current decreases proportionally becauseTo do this, the voltage of the power plant is increased by a step-up transformer, that is stepped up, and the current decreases proportionally because

The lower current $I_{ {transmitted }}$ in the transmission wires reduces the Joule losses, which is heating of the wire due to a current flow. This heating is caused by the small, but nonzero, resistance $R_{ {wire }}$ of the transmission wires. The power lost to the environment through this heat isThe power lost to the environment through this heat is


P_{ {lost }}=I_{ {transmitted }}^{2} R_{ {wire }},

which is proportional to the current squared in the transmission wire. This is why the transmitted current $I_{ {transmitted }}$ must be as small as possible and, consequently, the voltage must be large to transmit the power $P_{ {transmitted }}$.This is why the transmitted current $I_{ {transmitted }}$ must be as small as possible and, consequently, the voltage must be large to transmit the power $P_{ {transmitted }}$.

Electric power is usually generated at greater than $10 $, and transmitted long distances at voltages ranging from $120 $ to $700 $ to limit energy losses. Local power distribution to neighborhoods or industries goes through a substation and is sent short distances at voltages ranging from 5 to $13 $.

In the preceding section, we learned that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetrical, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. In 1831, some 12 years after the discovery that an electric current generates a magnetic field, English scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1862) and American scientist Joseph Henry (1797-1878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating currents with magnetic fields is called induction; this process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb force.f generating currents with magnetic fields is called induction; this process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb force.

When Faraday discovered what is now called Faraday's law of induction, Queen Victoria asked him what possible use was electricity. "Madam," he replied, "What good is a baby?" Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The electric generator-found in everything from automobiles to bicycles to nuclear power plants-uses magnetism to generate electric current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances.e magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances.

One experiment Faraday did to demonstrate magnetic induction was to move a bar magnet through a wire coil and measure the resulting electric current through the wire. A schematic of this experiment is shown in Figure 20.33. He found that current is induced only when the magnet moves with respect to the coil. When the magnet is motionless with respect to the coil, no current is induced in the coil, as in Figure 20.33. In addition, moving the magnet in the opposite direction (compare Figure 20.33 with Figure 20.33) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare Figure 20.33 with Figure 20.33) results in a current in the opposite direction. magnet in the opposite direction (compare Figure 20.33 with Figure 20.33) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare Figure 20.33 with Figure 20.33) results in a current in the opposite direction.

Try moving the magnet through a four-turn coil and through a two-turn coil. For the same magnet speed, which coil produces a higher voltage?For the same magnet speed, which coil produces a higher voltage?

If a current is induced in the coil, Faraday reasoned that there must be what he called an electromotive force pushing the charges through the coil. This interpretation turned out to be incorrect; instead, the external source doing the work of moving the magnet adds energy to the charges in the coil. The energy added per unit charge has units of volts, so the electromotive force is actually a potential. Unfortunately, the name electromotive force stuck and with it the potential for confusing it with a real force. For this reason, we avoid the term electromotive force and just use the abbreviation emf, which has the mathematical $  The emf may be defined as the rate at which energy is drawn from a source per unit current flowing through a circuit. Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge added by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge
released as the charges flow through a circuit.Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge added by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge
released as the charges flow through a circuit.

To understand why an emf is generated in a coil due to a moving magnet, consider Figure 20.34, which shows a bar magnet moving downward with respect to a wire loop. Initially, seven magnetic field lines are going through the loop (see left-hand image). Because the magnet is moving away from the coil, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop after a short time $ t$ (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field. Mathematically, we express this asMathematically, we express this as

where $ B$ is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time $ t$ and $A$ is the area of the loop.where $ B$ is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time $ t$ and $A$ is the area of the loop.

Figure 20.34 The bar magnet moves downward with respect to the wire loop, so that the number of magnetic field lines going through the loop decreases with time. This causes an emf to be induced in the loop, creating an electric current.This causes an emf to be induced in the loop, creating an electric current.

Note that magnetic field lines that lie in the plane of the wire loop do not actually pass through the loop, as shown by the leftmost loop in Figure 20.35. In this figure, the arrow coming out of the loop is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. In Figure 20.35, as the loop is rotated from $$ to $$, the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, which is $B  Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, which is $B  

This is analogous to a sail in the wind. Think of the conducting loop as the sail and the magnetic field as the wind. To maximize the force of the wind on the sail, the sail is oriented so that its surface vector points in the same direction as the winds, as in the right-most loop in Figure 20.35. When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the leftmost loop in Figure 20.35, then the wind exerts no force on the sail.When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the leftmost loop in Figure 20.35, then the wind exerts no force on the sail.

Thus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality $E   B /  t$ becomesThus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality $E   B /  t$ becomes

Figure 20.35 The magnetic field lies in the plane of the left-most loop, so it cannot generate an emf in this case. When the loop is rotated so that the angle of the magnetic field with the vector perpendicular to the area of the loop increases to $90^{ (see right-most loop), the magnetic field contributes maximally to the emf in the loop. The dots show where the magnetic field lines intersect the plane defined by the loop.The dots show where the magnetic field lines intersect the plane defined by the loop.

Another way to reduce the number of magnetic field lines that go through the conducting loop in Figure 20.35 is not to move the magnet but to make the loop smaller. Experiments show that changing the area of a conducting loop in a stable magnetic field induces an emf in the loop. Thus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the product of the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop areaThus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the product of the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop area

where $B   is the perpendicular magnetic field and $A$ is the area of the loop. The product $B A   is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area $A$. Going back to our sail analogy, it would be proportional to the force of the wind on the sail. It is called the magnetic flux and is represented by $It is called the magnetic flux and is represented by $

The last question to answer before we can change the proportionality into an equation is "In what direction does the current flow?" The Russian scientist Heinrich Lenz (1804-1865) explained that the current flows in the direction that creates a magnetic field that tries to keep the flux constant in the loop. For example, consider again Figure 20.34. The motion of the bar magnet causes the number of upward-pointing magnetic field lines that go through the loop to decrease. Therefore, an emf is generated in the loop that drives a current in the direction that creates more upward-pointing magnetic field lines. By using the righthand rule, we see that this current must flow in the direction shown in the figure. To express the fact that the induced emf acts to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality $    /  t$., which gives Faraday's law of induction. fact that the induced emf acts to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality $    /  t$., which gives Faraday's law of induction.

Lenz's law is very important. To better understand it, consider Figure 20.36, which shows a magnet moving with respect to a wire coil and the direction of the resulting current in the coil. In the top row, the north pole of the magnet approaches the coil, so the magnetic field lines from the magnet point toward the coil. Thus, the magnetic field $}=B_{ {mag }}()$ pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz's law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field $}=B_{ {coil }}(-)$ inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field $$ coil, and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of Figure 20.36. Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(a).Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(a).

In Figure 4(b), the direction in which the magnet moves is reversed. In the coil, the right-pointing magnetic field $}$ due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz's law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field $}$ in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers (Figure 4(b)).Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers (Figure 4(b)).

Finally, in Figure 4(c), the magnet is reversed so that the south pole is nearest the coil. Now the magnetic field $}$ points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase. Lenz's law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the righthand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(c).Using the righthand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(c).

DiscussionDiscussion

Let's see if the minus sign makes sense in Faraday's law of induction. Define the direction of the magnetic field to be the positive direction. This means the change in the magnetic field is negative, as we found above. The minus sign in Faraday's law of induction negates the negative change in the magnetic field, leaving us with a positive current. Therefore, the current must flow in the direction of the magnetic field, which is what we found.Therefore, the current must flow in the direction of the magnetic field, which is what we found.

Now try defining the positive direction to be the direction opposite that of the magnetic field, that is positive is to the left in Figure 20.37. In this case, you will find a negative current. But since the positive direction is to the left, a negative current must flow to the right, which again agrees with what we found by using Lenz's law.But since the positive direction is to the left, a negative current must flow to the right, which again agrees with what we found by using Lenz's law.

As the rod slides to the right, the magnetic flux passing through the circuit increases. Lenz's law tells us that the current induced will create a magnetic field that will counter this increase. Thus, the magnetic field created by the induced current must be into the page. Curling your right-hand fingers around the loop in the clockwise direction makes your right thumb point into the page, which is the desired direction of the magnetic field. Thus, the current must flow in the clockwise direction around the circuit.Thus, the current must flow in the clockwise direction around the circuit.

Using $F=I  B   the force required to pull the wire at a constant speed $v$ isUsing $F=I  B   the force required to pull the wire at a constant speed $v$ is


F_{ {pull }}=I  B    B

F_{ {pull }}=I  B    B


where we used the fact that the angle $ between the current and the magnetic field is $90^{ Inserting our expression above for the current into this equation giveswhere we used the fact that the angle $ between the current and the magnetic field is $90^{ Inserting our expression above for the current into this equation gives


F_{ {pull }}=I  B=-{R}( B)=- v 

F_{ {pull }}=I  B=-{R}( B)=- v 


The power contributed by the agent pulling the rod is $F_{ {pull }} v$, orThe power contributed by the agent pulling the rod is $F_{ {pull }} v$, or


P_{ {pull }}=F_{ {pull }} v=- v^{2} 

P_{ {pull }}=F_{ {pull }} v=- v^{2} 


The power dissipated by the circuit isThe power dissipated by the circuit is


P_{ {dissipated }}=I^{2} R={R} R= v^{2} 

P_{ {dissipated }}=I^{2} R={R} R= v^{2} 


We thus see that $P_{ {pull }}+P_{ {dissipated }}=0$, which means that power is conserved in the system consisting of the circuit and the agent that pulls the rod. Thus, energy is conserved in this system.Thus, energy is conserved in this system.

Between light acting as discrete chunks, massless particles providing momenta, and fundamental particles behaving like waves, it may often seem like something out of Alice in Wonderland.Between light acting as discrete chunks, massless particles providing momenta, and fundamental particles behaving like waves, it may often seem like something out of Alice in Wonderland.

Our first story of curious significance begins with a T-shirt. You are likely aware that wearing a tight black T-shirt outside on a hot day provides a significantly less comfortable experience than wearing a white shirt. Black shirts, as well as all other black objects, will absorb and re-emit a significantly greater amount of radiation from the sun. This shirt is a good approximation of what is called a blackbody.This shirt is a good approximation of what is called a blackbody.

A perfect blackbody is one that absorbs and re-emits all radiated energy that is incident upon it. Imagine wearing a tight shirt that did this! This phenomenon is often modeled with quite a different scenario. Imagine carving a small hole in an oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. As the temperature of this container gets hotter and hotter, the radiation out of this dark hole would increase as well, re-emitting all energy provided it by the increased temperature. The hole may even begin to glow in different colors as the temperature is increased. Like a burner on your stove, the hole would glow red, then orange, then blue, as the temperature is increased. In time, the hole would continue to glow but the light would be invisible to our eyes. This container is a good model of a perfect blackbody.This container is a good model of a perfect blackbody.

Figure 21.2 Graphs of blackbody radiation (from an ideal radiator) at three different radiator temperatures. The intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the peak of the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The shape of the spectrum cannot be described with classical physics.The shape of the spectrum cannot be described with classical physics.


When encountering a new graph, it is best to try to interpret the graph before you read about it. Doing this will make the following text more meaningful and will help to remind yourself of some of the key concepts within the section.Doing this will make the following text more meaningful and will help to remind yourself of some of the key concepts within the section.


Figure 21.2 is a plot of radiation intensity against radiated wavelength. In other words, it shows how the intensity of radiated light changes when a blackbody is heated to a particular temperature.In other words, it shows how the intensity of radiated light changes when a blackbody is heated to a particular temperature.

It may help to just follow the bottom-most red line labeled 3,000 K, red hot. The graph shows that when a blackbody acquires a temperature of $3,000 $, it radiates energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the energy is most intensely emitted at a wavelength of approximately $1000 $. This is in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. While a body at this temperature would appear red-hot to our eyes, it would truly appear 'infrared-hot' if we were able to see the entire spectrum.While a body at this temperature would appear red-hot to our eyes, it would truly appear 'infrared-hot' if we were able to see the entire spectrum.

A few other important notes regarding Figure 21.2:A few other important notes regarding Figure 21.2:


   As temperature increases, the total amount of energy radiated increases. This is shown by examining the area underneath each line.This is shown by examining the area underneath each line.

   Regardless of temperature, all red lines on the graph undergo a consistent pattern. While electromagnetic radiation is emitted throughout the spectrum, the intensity of this radiation peaks at one particular wavelength.While electromagnetic radiation is emitted throughout the spectrum, the intensity of this radiation peaks at one particular wavelength.

   As the temperature changes, the wavelength of greatest radiation intensity changes. At 4,000 K, the radiation is most intense in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum. At 6,000 K, the blackbody would radiate white hot, due to intense radiation throughout the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Remember that white light is the emission of all visible colors simultaneously.Remember that white light is the emission of all visible colors simultaneously.

   As the temperature increases, the frequency of light providing the greatest intensity increases as well. Recall the equation $v=f  Because the speed of light is constant, frequency and wavelength are inversely related. This is verified by the leftward movement of the three red lines as temperature is increased.This is verified by the leftward movement of the three red lines as temperature is increased.



While in science it is important to categorize observations, theorizing as to why the observations exist is crucial to scientific advancement. Why doesn't a blackbody emit radiation evenly across all wavelengths? Why does the temperature of the body change the peak wavelength that is radiated? Why does an increase in temperature cause the peak wavelength emitted to decrease? It is questions like these that drove significant research at the turn of the twentieth century. And within the context of these questions, Max Planck discovered something of tremendous importance.And within the context of these questions, Max Planck discovered something of tremendous importance.


The prevailing theory at the time of Max Planck's discovery was that intensity and frequency were related by the equation $I={}$. This equation, derived from classical physics and using wave phenomena, infers that as wavelength increases, the intensity of energy provided will decrease with an inverse-squared relationship. This relationship is graphed in Figure 21.3 and shows a troubling trend. For starters, it should be apparent that the graph from this equation does not match the blackbody graphs found experimentally. Additionally, it shows that for an object of any temperature, there should be an infinite amount of energy quickly emitted in the shortest wavelengths. When theory and experimental results clash, it is important to re-evaluate both models. The disconnect between theory and reality was termed the ultraviolet catastrophe.The disconnect between theory and reality was termed the ultraviolet catastrophe.

Figure 21.3 The graph above shows the true spectral measurements by a blackbody against those predicted by the classical theory at the time. The discord between the predicted classical theory line and the actual results is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.The discord between the predicted classical theory line and the actual results is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.

Due to concerns over the ultraviolet catastrophe, Max Planck began to question whether another factor impacted the relationship between intensity and wavelength. This factor, he posited, should affect the probability that short wavelength light would be emitted. Should this factor reduce the probability of short wavelength light, it would cause the radiance curve to not progress infinitely as in the classical theory, but would instead cause the curve to precipitate back downward as is shown in the $5,000 , 4,000 $, and 3,000 K temperature lines of the graph in Figure 21.3. Planck noted that this factor, whatever it may be, must also be dependent on temperature, as the intensity decreases at lower and lower wavelengths as the temperature increases.Planck noted that this factor, whatever it may be, must also be dependent on temperature, as the intensity decreases at lower and lower wavelengths as the temperature increases.

The determination of this probability factor was a groundbreaking discovery in physics, yielding insight not just into light but also into energy and matter itself. It would be the basis for Planck's 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics and would result in the transition of physics from classical to modern understanding. In an attempt to determine the cause of the probability factor, Max Planck constructed a new theory. This theory, which created the branch of physics called quantum mechanics, speculated that the energy radiated by the blackbody could exist only in specific numerical, or quantum, states. This theory is described by the equation $E=n h f$, where $n$ is any nonnegative integer $(0,1,2,3,  and $h$ is Planck's constant, given by $h=6.626  10^{-34}   $, and $f$ is frequency.This theory is described by the equation $E=n h f$, where $n$ is any nonnegative integer $(0,1,2,3,  and $h$ is Planck's constant, given by $h=6.626  10^{-34}   $, and $f$ is frequency.

Through this equation, Planck's probability factor can be more clearly understood. Each frequency of light provides a specific quantized amount of energy. Low frequency light, associated with longer wavelengths would provide a smaller amount of energy, while high frequency light, associated with shorter wavelengths, would provide a larger amount of energy. For specified temperatures with specific total energies, it makes sense that more low frequency light would be radiated than high frequency light. To a degree, the relationship is like pouring coins through a funnel. More of the smaller pennies would be able to pass through the funnel than the larger quarters. In other words, because the value of the coin is somewhat related to the size of the coin, the probability of a quarter passing through the funnel is reduced!In other words, because the value of the coin is somewhat related to the size of the coin, the probability of a quarter passing through the funnel is reduced!

Furthermore, an increase in temperature would signify the presence of higher energy. As a result, the greater amount of total blackbody energy would allow for more of the high frequency, short wavelength, energies to be radiated. This permits the peak of the blackbody curve to drift leftward as the temperature increases, as it does from the 3,000 K to 4,000 K to 5,000 K values. Furthering our coin analogy, consider a wider funnel. This funnel would permit more quarters to pass through and allow for a reduction in concern about the probability factor.This funnel would permit more quarters to pass through and allow for a reduction in concern about the probability factor.

In summary, it is the interplay between the predicted classical model and the quantum probability that creates the curve depicted in Figure 21.3. Just as quarters have a higher currency denomination than pennies, higher frequencies come with larger
amounts of energy. However, just as the probability of a quarter passing through a fixed diameter funnel is reduced, so is the probability of a high frequency light existing in a fixed temperature object. As is often the case in physics, it is the balancing of multiple incredible ideas that finally allows for better understanding.As is often the case in physics, it is the balancing of multiple incredible ideas that finally allows for better understanding.


It may be helpful at this point to further consider the idea of quantum states. Atoms, molecules, and fundamental electron and proton charges are all examples of physical entities that are quantized-that is, they appear only in certain discrete values and do not have every conceivable value. On the macroscopic scale, this is not a revolutionary concept. A standing wave on a string allows only particular harmonics described by integers. Going up and down a hill using discrete stair steps causes your potential energy to take on discrete values as you move from step to step. Furthermore, we cannot have a fraction of an atom, or part of an electron's charge, or 14.33 cents. Rather, everything is built of integral multiples of these substructures.Rather, everything is built of integral multiples of these substructures.

That said, to discover quantum states within a phenomenon that science had always considered continuous would certainly be surprising. When Max Planck was able to use quantization to correctly describe the experimentally known shape of the blackbody spectrum, it was the first indication that energy was quantized on a small scale as well. This discovery earned Planck the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 and was such a revolutionary departure from classical physics that Planck himself was reluctant to accept his own idea. The general acceptance of Planck's energy quantization was greatly enhanced by Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect (discussed in the next section), which took energy quantization a step further.al acceptance of Planck's energy quantization was greatly enhanced by Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect (discussed in the next section), which took energy quantization a step further.

The number of visible photons per second is directly related to the amount of energy emitted each second, also known as the bulb's power. By determining the bulb's power, the energy emitted each second can be found. Since the power is given in watts, which is joules per second, the energy will be in joules. By comparing this to the amount of energy associated with each photon, the number of photons emitted each second can be determined.By comparing this to the amount of energy associated with each photon, the number of photons emitted each second can be determined.

This example verifies that as the wavelength of light decreases, the quantum energy increases. This explains why a fire burning with a blue flame is considered more dangerous than a fire with a red flame. Each photon of short-wavelength blue light emitted carries a greater amount of energy than a long-wavelength red light. This example also helps explain the differences in the 3,000 $, 4,000 $, and 6,000 K lines shown in the first figure in this section.

When light strikes certain materials, it can eject electrons from them. This is called the photoelectric effect, meaning that light (photo) produces electricity. One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters, such as those that adjust the automatic iris in various types of cameras. Another use is in solar cells, as you probably have in your calculator or have seen on a rooftop or a roadside sign. These make use of the photoelectric effect to convert light into electricity for running different devices.These make use of the photoelectric effect to convert light into electricity for running different devices.

When Max Planck theorized that energy was quantized in a blackbody radiator, it is unlikely that he would have recognized just how revolutionary his idea was. Using tools similar to the light meter in Figure 21.5, it would take a scientist of Albert Einstein's stature to fully discover the implications of Max Planck's radical concept.Using tools similar to the light meter in Figure 21.5, it would take a scientist of Albert Einstein's stature to fully discover the implications of Max Planck's radical concept.

Through careful observations of the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein realized that there were several characteristics that could be explained only if EM radiation is itself quantized. While these characteristics will be explained a bit later in this section, you can already begin to appreciate why Einstein's idea is very important. It means that the apparently continuous stream of energy in an EM wave is actually not a continuous stream at all. In fact, the EM wave itself is actually composed of tiny quantum packets of energy called photons.In fact, the EM wave itself is actually composed of tiny quantum packets of energy called photons.

A beam from a flashlight, which to this point had been considered a wave, instead could now be viewed as a series of photons, each providing a specific amount of energy see Figure 21.6. Furthermore, the amount of energy within each individual photon is based upon its individual frequency, as
dictated by $E=h f$. As a result, the total amount of energy provided by the beam could now be viewed as the sum of all frequency-dependent photon energies added together.As a result, the total amount of energy provided by the beam could now be viewed as the sum of all frequency-dependent photon energies added together.

Just as with Planck's blackbody radiation, Einstein's concept of the photon could take hold in the scientific community only if it could succeed where classical physics failed. The photoelectric effect would be a key to demonstrating Einstein's brilliance.The photoelectric effect would be a key to demonstrating Einstein's brilliance.

Consider the following five properties of the photoelectric effect. All of these properties are consistent with the idea that individual photons of EM radiation are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining the photon's energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us consider what happens with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy $h f$.For simplicity, let us consider what happens with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy $h f$.

Figure 21.7 Incident radiation strikes a clean metal surface, ejecting multiple electrons from it. The manner in which the frequency and intensity of the incoming radiation affect the ejected electrons strongly suggests that electromagnetic radiation is quantized. This event, called the photoelectric effect, is strong evidence for the existence of photons.This event, called the photoelectric effect, is strong evidence for the existence of photons.


   If we vary the frequency of the EM radiation falling on a clean metal surface, we find the following: For a given material, there is a threshold frequency $f_{0}$ for the EM radiation below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of intensity. Using the photon model, the explanation for this is clear. Individual photons interact with individual electrons. Thus if the energy of an individual photon is too low to break an electron away, no electrons will be ejected. However, if EM radiation were a simple wave, sufficient energy could be obtained simply by increasing the intensity.However, if EM radiation were a simple wave, sufficient energy could be obtained simply by increasing the intensity.

   Once EM radiation falls on a material, electrons are ejected without delay. As soon as an individual photon of sufficiently high frequency is absorbed by an individual electron, the electron is ejected. If the EM radiation were a simple wave, several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be deposited at the metal surface in order to eject an electron.If the EM radiation were a simple wave, several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be deposited at the metal surface in order to eject an electron.

   The number of electrons ejected per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the EM radiation and to no other characteristic. High-intensity EM radiation consists of large numbers of photons per unit area, with all photons having the same characteristic energy, $h f$. The increased number of photons per unit area results in an increased number of electrons per unit area ejected.The increased number of photons per unit area results in an increased number of electrons per unit area ejected.

   If we vary the intensity of the EM radiation and measure the energy of ejected electrons, we find the following: The maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons is independent of the intensity of the $E M$ radiation. Instead, as noted in point 3 above, increased intensity results in more electrons of the same energy being ejected. If EM radiation were a simple wave, a higher intensity could transfer more energy, and higher-energy electrons would be ejected.If EM radiation were a simple wave, a higher intensity could transfer more energy, and higher-energy electrons would be ejected.

   The kinetic energy $$ of an ejected electron equals the photon energy minus the binding energy $$ of the electron in the
specific material. An individual photon can give all of its energy to an electron. The photon's energy is partly used to break the electron away from the material. The remainder goes into the ejected electron's kinetic energy. In equation form, this is given byIn equation form, this is given by

The energy of this $420 $ photon of violet light is a tiny fraction of a joule, and so it is no wonder that a single photon would be difficult for us to sense directly-humans are more attuned to energies on the order of joules. But looking at the energy in electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with about $1 $ of energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order of $$, so that the photon in this example could have biological effects, such as sunburn. The ejected electron has rather low energy, and it would not travel far,
except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a retarding potential of only $0.26 $, a slightly larger KE than calculated above. In fact, if the photon wavelength were longer and its energy less than $2.71 $, then the formula would give a negative kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the $420 $ photons with their $2.96 $ energy are not much above the frequency threshold. You can see for yourself that the threshold wavelength is $458 $ (blue light). This means that if calcium metal were used in a light meter, the meter would be insensitive to wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light meter would be completely insensitive to red light, for example.Such a light meter would be completely insensitive to red light, for example.

While Einstein's understanding of the photoelectric effect was a transformative discovery in the early 1900 s, its presence is ubiquitous today.

All these devices rely on photoconductive cells. These cells are activated when light is absorbed by a semi-conductive material, knocking off a free electron. When this happens, an electron void is left behind, which attracts a nearby electron. The movement of this electron, and the resultant chain of electron movements, produces a current. If electron ejection continues, further holes are created, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity of the cell.

This sound is actually created using the photoelectric effect! The audiotape in the projector booth is a transparent piece of film of varying width. This film is fed between a photocell and a bright light produced by an exciter lamp. As the transparent portion of the film varies in width, the amount of light that strikes the photocell varies as well. As a result, the current in the photoconductive circuit changes with the width of the filmstrip. This changing current is converted to a changing frequency, which creates the soundtrack commonly heard in the theater.This changing current is converted to a changing frequency, which creates the soundtrack commonly heard in the theater.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Earth receives enough sunlight each hour to power the entire globe for a year. While converting all of this energy is impossible, the job of the solar energy physicist is to explore and improve upon solar energy conversion technologies so that we may harness more of this abundant resource.rting all of this energy is impossible, the job of the solar energy physicist is to explore and improve upon solar energy conversion technologies so that we may harness more of this abundant resource.

The field of solar energy is not a new one. For over half a century, satellites and spacecraft have utilized photovoltaic cells to create current and power their operations. As time has gone on, scientists have worked to adapt this process so that it may be used in homes, businesses, and full-scale power stations using solar cells like the one shown in Figure 21.9.As time has gone on, scientists have worked to adapt this process so that it may be used in homes, businesses, and full-scale power stations using solar cells like the one shown in Figure 21.9.

Figure 21.9 A solar cell is an example of a photovoltaic cell. As light strikes the cell, the cell absorbs the energy of the photons. If this energy exceeds the binding energy of the electrons, then electrons will be forced to move in the cell, thereby producing a current. This current may be used for a variety of purposes.

Solar energy is converted to electrical energy in one of two manners: direct transfer through photovoltaic cells or thermal conversion through the use of a CSP, concentrating solar power, system. Unlike electric eyes, which trip a mechanism when current is lost, photovoltaic cells utilize semiconductors to directly transfer the electrons released through the photoelectric effect into a directed current. The energy from this current can then be converted for storage, or immediately used in an electric process. A CSP system is an indirect method of energy conversion. In this process, light from the Sun is channeled using parabolic mirrors. The light from these mirrors strikes a thermally conductive material, which then heats a pool of water. This water, in turn, is converted to steam, which turns a turbine and creates electricity. While indirect, this method has long been the traditional means of large-scale power generation.While indirect, this method has long been the traditional means of large-scale power generation.

There are, of course, limitations to the efficacy of solar power. Cloud cover, nightfall, and incident angle strike at high altitudes are all factors that directly influence the amount of light energy available. Additionally, the creation of photovoltaic cells requires rare-earth minerals that can be difficult to obtain. However, the major role of a solar energy physicist is to find ways to improve the efficiency of the solar energy conversion process. Currently, this is done by experimenting with new semi conductive materials, by refining current energy transfer methods, and by determining new ways of incorporating solar structures into the current power grid.his is done by experimenting with new semi conductive materials, by refining current energy transfer methods, and by determining new ways of incorporating solar structures into the current power grid.

Additionally, many solar physicists are looking into ways to allow for increased solar use in impoverished, more remote locations. Because solar energy conversion does not require a connection to a large-scale power grid, research into thinner, more mobile materials will permit remote cultures to use solar cells to convert sunlight collected during the day into stored energy that can then be used at night. power grid, research into thinner, more mobile materials will permit remote cultures to use solar cells to convert sunlight collected during the day into stored energy that can then be used at night.

Regardless of the application, solar energy physicists are an important part of the future in responsible energy growth. While a doctoral degree is often necessary for advanced research applications, a bachelor's or master's degree in a related science or engineering field is typically enough to gain access into the industry. Computer skills are very important for energy modeling, including knowledge of CAD software for design purposes. In addition, the ability to collaborate and communicate with others is critical to becoming a solar energy physicist.In addition, the ability to collaborate and communicate with others is critical to becoming a solar energy physicist.

Despite the odd nature of photons, scientists prior to Einstein had long suspected that the fundamental particle of
electromagnetic radiation shared properties with our more macroscopic particles. This is no clearer than when considering the photoelectric effect, where photons knock electrons out of a substance. While it is strange to think of a massless particle exhibiting momentum, it is now a well-established fact within the scientific community.

Figure 21.10 The tails of the Hale-Bopp comet point away from the Sun, evidence that light has momentum. Dust emanating from the body of the comet forms this tail. Particles of dust are pushed away from the Sun by light reflecting from them. The blue, ionized gas tail is also produced by photons interacting with atoms in the comet material.

Figure 21.10 shows a comet with two prominent tails. Comet tails are composed of gases and dust evaporated from the body of the comet and ionized gas. What most people do not know about the tails is that they always point away from the Sun rather than trailing behind the comet. This can be seen in the diagram.This can be seen in the diagram.

Why would this be the case? The evidence indicates that the dust particles of the comet are forced away from the Sun when photons strike them. Evidently, photons carry momentum in the direction of their motion away from the Sun, and some of this momentum is transferred to dust particles in collisions. The blue tail is caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma consisting primarily of protons and electrons evaporating from the corona of the Sun.The blue tail is caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma consisting primarily of protons and electrons evaporating from the corona of the Sun.


Momentum is conserved in quantum mechanics, just as it is in relativity and classical physics. Some of the earliest direct experimental evidence of this came from the scattering of X-ray photons by electrons in substances, a phenomenon discovered by American physicist Arthur H. Compton (1892-1962). Around 1923, Compton observed that X-rays reflecting from materials had decreased energy and correctly interpreted this as being due to the scattering of the X-ray photons by electrons. This phenomenon could be handled as a collision between two particles-a photon and an electron at rest in the material. After careful observation, it was found that both energy and momentum were conserved in the collision. See Figure 21.11. For the discovery of this conserved scattering, now known as the Compton effect, Arthur Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929.For the discovery of this conserved scattering, now known as the Compton effect, Arthur Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929.

We can see that photon momentum is small, since $=h /  and $h$ is very small. It is for this reason that we do not ordinarily observe photon momentum. Our mirrors do not recoil when light reflects from them, except perhaps in cartoons. Compton saw the effects of photon momentum because he was observing X-rays, which have a small wavelength and a relatively large momentum, interacting with the lightest of particles, the electron.Compton saw the effects of photon momentum because he was observing X-rays, which have a small wavelength and a relatively large momentum, interacting with the lightest of particles, the electron.

Even in huge numbers, the total momentum that photons carry is small. An electron that carries the same momentum as a $500-$ photon will have a $1,460  / $ velocity, which is clearly nonrelativistic. This is borne out by the experimental observation that it takes far less energy to give an electron the same momentum as a photon. That said, for high-energy photons interacting with small masses, photon momentum may be significant. Even on a large scale, photon momentum can have an effect if there
are enough of them and if there is nothing to prevent the slow recoil of matter. Comet tails are one example, but there are also proposals to build space sails that use huge low-mass mirrors (made of aluminized Mylar) to reflect sunlight. In the vacuum of space, the mirrors would gradually recoil and could actually accelerate spacecraft within the solar system. See the following figure.See the following figure.

Traversing the Solar System using nothing but the Sun's power has long been a fantasy of scientists and science fiction writers alike. Though physicists like Compton, Einstein, and Planck all provided evidence of light's propulsive capacity, it is only recently that the technology has become available to truly put these visions into motion.

A citizen-funded project headed by the Planetary Society, the 5.45-million-dollar LightSail-1 project is set to launch two crafts into orbit around the Earth. Each craft is equipped with a 32-square-meter solar sail prepared to unfurl once a rocket has launched it to an appropriate altitude. The sails are made of large mirrors, each a quarter of the thickness of a trash bag, which will receive an impulse from the Sun's reflecting photons. Each time the Sun's photon strikes the craft's reflective surface and bounces off, it will provide a momentum to the sail much greater than if the photon were simply absorbed.Each time the Sun's photon strikes the craft's reflective surface and bounces off, it will provide a momentum to the sail much greater than if the photon were simply absorbed.

Attached to three tiny satellites called CubeSats, whose combined volume is no larger than a loaf of bread, the received momentum from the Sun's photons should be enough to record a substantial increase in orbital speed. The intent of the LightSail-1 mission is to prove that the technology behind photon momentum travel is sound and can be done cheaply. A test flight in May 2015 showed that the craft's Mylar sails could unfurl on command. With another successful result in 2016, the Planetary Society will be planning future versions of the craft with the hopes of eventually achieving interplanetary satellite travel.

We have long known that EM radiation is like a wave, capable of interference and diffraction. We now see that light can also be modeled as particles-massless photons of discrete energy and momentum. We call this twofold nature the particle-wave duality, meaning that EM radiation has properties of both particles and waves. This may seem contradictory, since we ordinarily deal with large objects that never act like both waves and particles. An ocean wave, for example, looks nothing like a grain of sand. However, this so-called duality is simply a term for properties of the photon analogous to phenomena we can observe directly, on a macroscopic scale. See Figure 21.14. If this term seems strange, it is because we do not ordinarily observe details on the quantum level directly, and our observations yield either particle-like or wave-like properties, but never both simultaneously.seems strange, it is because we do not ordinarily observe details on the quantum level directly, and our observations yield either particle-like or wave-like properties, but never both simultaneously.

Since we have a particle-wave duality for photons, and since we have seen connections between photons and matter in that both have momentum, it is reasonable to ask whether there is a particle-wave duality for matter as well. If the EM radiation we once thought to be a pure wave has particle properties, is it possible that matter has wave properties? The answer, strangely, is yes. The consequences of this are tremendous, as particle-wave duality has been a constant source of scientific wonder during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.The consequences of this are tremendous, as particle-wave duality has been a constant source of scientific wonder during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

INTRODUCTION From childhood on, we learn that atoms are a substructure of all things around us, from the air we breathe to the autumn leaves that blanket a forest trail. Invisible to the eye, the atoms have properties that are used to explain many phenomena-a theme found throughout this text. In this chapter, we discuss the discovery of atoms and their own substructures. We will then learn about the forces that keep them together and the tremendous energy they release when we break them apart. Finally, we will see how the knowledge and manipulation of atoms allows us to better understand geology, biology, and the world around us.Finally, we will see how the knowledge and manipulation of atoms allows us to better understand geology, biology, and the world around us.

How do we know that atoms are really there if we cannot see them with our own eyes? While often taken for granted, our knowledge of the existence and structure of atoms is the result of centuries of contemplation and experimentation. The earliest known speculation on the atom dates back to the fifth century B.C., when Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus contemplated whether a substance could be divided without limit into ever smaller pieces. Since then, scientists such as John Dalton (1766-1844), Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856), and Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) helped to discover the properties of that fundamental structure of matter. While much could be written about any number of important scientific philosophers, this section will focus on the role played by Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937). Though his understanding of our most elemental matter is rooted in the success of countless prior investigations, his surprising discovery about the interior of the atom is most fundamental in explaining so many well-known phenomena.ost elemental matter is rooted in the success of countless prior investigations, his surprising discovery about the interior of the atom is most fundamental in explaining so many well-known phenomena.


In the early 1900's, the plum pudding model was the accepted model of the atom. Proposed in 1904 by J. J. Thomson, the model suggested that the atom was a spherical ball of positive charge, with negatively charged electrons scattered evenly throughout. In that model, the positive charges made up the pudding, while the electrons acted as isolated plums. During its short life, the model could be used to explain why most particles were neutral, although with an unbalanced number of plums, electrically charged atoms could exist.During its short life, the model could be used to explain why most particles were neutral, although with an unbalanced number of plums, electrically charged atoms could exist.

When Ernest Rutherford began his gold foil experiment in 1909, it is unlikely that anyone would have expected that the plum pudding model would be challenged. However, using a radioactive source, a thin sheet of gold foil, and a phosphorescent screen, Rutherford would uncover something so great that he would later call it "the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life"[James, L. K. (1993). Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, 1901-1992. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society.]Washington, DC: American Chemical Society.]

The experiment that Rutherford designed is shown in Figure 22.2. As you can see in, a radioactive source was placed in a lead container with a hole in one side to produce a beam of positively charged helium particles, called alpha particles. Then, a thin gold foil sheet was placed in the beam. When the high-energy alpha particles passed through the gold foil, they were scattered. The scattering was observed from the bright spots they produced when they struck the phosphor screen.The scattering was observed from the bright spots they produced when they struck the phosphor screen.

Figure 22.2 Rutherford's experiment gave direct evidence for the size and mass of the nucleus by scattering alpha particles from a thin gold foil. The scattering of particles suggests that the gold nuclei are very small and contain nearly all of the gold atom's mass. Particularly significant in showing the size of the nucleus are alpha particles that scatter to very large angles, much like a soccer ball bouncing off a goalie's head.Particularly significant in showing the size of the nucleus are alpha particles that scatter to very large angles, much like a soccer ball bouncing off a goalie's head.

The expectation of the plum pudding model was that the high-energy alpha particles would be scattered only slightly by the presence of the gold sheet. Because the energy of the alpha particles was much higher than those typically associated with atoms, the alpha particles should have passed through the thin foil much like a supersonic bowling ball would crash through a
few dozen rows of bowling pins. Any deflection was expected to be minor, and due primarily to the electrostatic Coulomb force between the alpha particles and the foil's interior electric charges.Any deflection was expected to be minor, and due primarily to the electrostatic Coulomb force between the alpha particles and the foil's interior electric charges.

However, the true result was nothing of the sort. While the majority of alpha particles passed through the foil unobstructed, Rutherford and his collaborators Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden found that alpha particles occasionally were scattered to large angles, and some even came back in the direction from which they came! The result, called Rutherford scattering, implied that the gold nuclei were actually very small when compared with the size of the gold atom. As shown in Figure 22.3, the dense nucleus is surrounded by mostly empty space of the atom, an idea verified by the fact that only 1 in 8,000 particles was scattered backward.As shown in Figure 22.3, the dense nucleus is surrounded by mostly empty space of the atom, an idea verified by the fact that only 1 in 8,000 particles was scattered backward.

Figure 22.3 An expanded view of the atoms in the gold foil in Rutherford's experiment. Circles represent the atoms that are about $10^{-10} $ in diameter, while the dots represent the nuclei that are about $10^{-15} $ in diameter. To be visible, the dots are much larger than scale-if the nuclei were actually the size of the dots, each atom would have a diameter of about five meters! Most alpha particles crash through but are relatively unaffected because of their high energy and the electron's small mass. Some, however, strike a nucleus and are scattered straight back. A detailed analysis of their interaction gives the size and mass of the nucleus.A detailed analysis of their interaction gives the size and mass of the nucleus.

Although the results of the experiment were published by his colleagues in 1909, it took Rutherford two years to convince himself of their meaning. Rutherford later wrote: "It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backwards ... [meant] ... the greatest part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a tiny nucleus." In 1911, Rutherford published his analysis together with a proposed model of the atom, which was in part based on Geiger's work from the previous year. As a result of the paper, the size of the nucleus was determined to be about $10^{-15} $, or 100,000 times smaller than the atom. That implies a huge density, on the order of $10^{15}  /$ $$, much greater than any macroscopic matter.That implies a huge density, on the order of $10^{15}  /$ $$, much greater than any macroscopic matter.

Based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment, as well as the mass of electrons, Rutherford proposed the planetary model of the atom. The planetary model of the atom pictures low-mass electrons orbiting a large-mass nucleus. The sizes of the electron orbits are large compared with the size of the nucleus, and most of the atom is a vacuum. The model is analogous to how low-mass planets in our solar system orbit the large-mass Sun. In the atom, the attractive Coulomb force is analogous to gravitation in the planetary system (see Figure 22.4).In the atom, the attractive Coulomb force is analogous to gravitation in the planetary system (see Figure 22.4).

Explore the answer through this simulation of the famous experiment in which he disproved the plum pudding model by observing alpha particles bouncing off atoms and determining that they must have a small core.e answer through this simulation of the famous experiment in which he disproved the plum pudding model by observing alpha particles bouncing off atoms and determining that they must have a small core.


As you progress through the model of the atom, consider the effect that experimentation has on the scientific process. Ask yourself the following: What would our model of the atom be without Rutherford's gold foil experiment? What further understanding of the atom would not have been gained? How would that affect our current technologies? Though often confusing, experiments taking place today to further understand composition of the atom could perhaps have a similar effect.e been gained?

In 1900, Max Planck recognized that all energy radiated from a source is emitted by atoms in quantum states. How would that radical idea relate to the interior of an atom? The answer was first found by investigating the spectrum of light or emission spectrum produced when a gas is highly energized.How would that radical idea relate to the interior of an atom? The answer was first found by investigating the spectrum of light or emission spectrum produced when a gas is highly energized.

Figure 22.5 shows how to isolate the emission spectrum of one such gas. The gas is placed in the discharge tube at the left, where it is energized to the point at which it begins to radiate energy or emit light. The radiated light is channeled by a thin slit and then passed through a diffraction grating, which will separate the light into its constituent wavelengths. The separated light will then strike the photographic film on the right.The separated light will then strike the photographic film on the right.

The spectrum of light created by excited iron shows a variety of discrete wavelengths emitted within the visible spectrum. Each element, when excited to the appropriate degree, will create a discrete emission spectrum as in part (b) of Figure 22.5. However, the wavelengths emitted will vary from element to element. The emission spectrum for iron was chosen for Figure 22.5 solely
because a substantial portion of its emission spectrum is within the visible spectrum. Figure 22.6 shows the emission spectrum for hydrogen. Note that, while discrete, a large portion of hydrogen emission takes place in the ultraviolet and infrared regions.Note that, while discrete, a large portion of hydrogen emission takes place in the ultraviolet and infrared regions.

Just as an emission spectrum shows all discrete wavelengths emitted by a gas, an absorption spectrum will show all light that is absorbed by a gas. Black lines exist where the wavelengths are absorbed, with the remainder of the spectrum lit by light is free to pass through. What relationship do you think exists between the black lines of a gas's absorption spectrum and the colored lines of its emission spectrum? Figure 22.7 shows the absorption spectrum of the Sun.

To tie the unique signatures of emission spectra to the composition of the atom itself would require clever thinking. Niels Bohr (1885-1962), a Danish physicist, did just that, by making immediate use of Rutherford's planetary model of the atom. Bohr, shown in Figure 22.8, became convinced of its validity and spent part of 1912 at Rutherford's laboratory. In 1913, after returning to Copenhagen, he began publishing his theory of the simplest atom, hydrogen, based on Rutherford's planetary model.In 1913, after returning to Copenhagen, he began publishing his theory of the simplest atom, hydrogen, based on Rutherford's planetary model.

Bohr was able to derive the formula for the hydrogen spectrum using basic physics, the planetary model of the atom, and some very important new conjectures. His first conjecture was that only certain orbits are allowed: In other words, in an atom, the orbits of electrons are quantized. Each quantized orbit has a different distinct energy, and electrons can move to a higher orbit by absorbing energy or drop to a lower orbit by emitting energy. Because of the quantized orbits, the amount of energy emitted or absorbed must also be quantized, producing the discrete spectra seen in Figure 22.5 and Figure 22.7. In equation form, the amount of energy absorbed or emitted can be found asIn equation form, the amount of energy absorbed or emitted can be found as


 E=E_{i}-E_{f}

 E=E_{i}-E_{f}


where $E_{i}$ refers to the energy of the initial quantized orbit, and $E_{f}$ refers to the energy of the final orbits. Furthermore, the wavelength emitted can be found using the equationFurthermore, the wavelength emitted can be found using the equation

It makes sense that energy is involved in changing orbits. For example, a burst of energy is required for a satellite to climb to a higher orbit. What is not expected is that atomic orbits should be quantized. Quantization is not observed for satellites or planets, which can have any orbit, given the proper energy (see Figure 22.9).Quantization is not observed for satellites or planets, which can have any orbit, given the proper energy (see Figure 22.9).

Figure 22.9 The planetary model of the atom, as modified by Bohr, has the orbits of the electrons quantized. Only certain orbits are allowed, explaining why atomic spectra are discrete or quantized. The energy carried away from an atom by a photon comes from the electron dropping from one allowed orbit to another and is thus quantized. The same is true for atomic absorption of photons.The same is true for atomic absorption of photons.

Figure 22.10 shows an energy-level diagram, a convenient way to display energy states. Each of the horizontal lines corresponds to the energy of an electron in a different orbital. Energy is plotted vertically with the lowest or ground state at the bottom and with excited states above. The vertical arrow downwards shows energy being emitted out of the atom due to an electron dropping from one excited state to another. That would correspond to a line shown on the atom's emission spectrum. The Lyman series shown in Figure 22.6 results from electrons dropping to the ground state, while the Balmer and Paschen series result to electrons dropping to the $n=2$ and $n=3$ states, respectively.The Lyman series shown in Figure 22.6 results from electrons dropping to the ground state, while the Balmer and Paschen series result to electrons dropping to the $n=2$ and $n=3$ states, respectively.

where $n$ corresponds to the orbital value from the atom's nucleus. The negative value in the equation is based upon a baseline energy of zero when the electron is infinitely far from the atom. As a result, the negative value shows that energy is necessary to free the electron from its orbital state. The minimum energy to free the electron is also referred to as its binding energy. The equation is only valid for atoms with single electrons in their orbital shells (like hydrogen). For ionized atoms similar to hydrogen, the following formula may be used.For ionized atoms similar to hydrogen, the following formula may be used.

One primary difference between the planetary model of the solar system and the planetary model of the atom is the cause of the circular motion. While gravitation causes the motion of orbiting planets around an interior star, the Coulomb force is responsible for the circular shape of the electron's orbit. The magnitude of the centripetal force is $ }$, while the magnitude of the Coulomb force is $^{2}}$. The assumption here is that the nucleus is more massive than the stationary electron, and the electron orbits about it. That is consistent with the planetary model of the atom.

Bohr was clever enough to find a way to calculate the electron orbital energies in hydrogen. That was an important first step that has been improved upon, but it is well worth repeating here, because it does correctly describe many characteristics of hydrogen. Assuming circular orbits, Bohr proposed that the angular momentum $L$ of an electron in its orbit is also quantized, that is, it has only specific, discrete values. The value for $L$ is given by the formulaThe value for $L$ is given by the formula


L=m_{e} v r_{n}=n (n=1,2,3, 

L=m_{e} v r_{n}=n (n=1,2,3, 


where $L$ is the angular momentum, $m_{e}$ is the electron's mass, $r_{n}$ is the radius of the $n$th orbit, and $h$ is Planck's constant. Note that angular momentum is $L=I  For a small object at a radius $, I=m r^{2}$, and $$, so thatNote that angular momentum is $L=I  For a small object at a radius $, I=m r^{2}$, and $$, so that

$L=I  r^{2} v r$. Quantization says that the value of $m v r$ can only be equal to $h / 2,2 h / 2,3 h / 2$, etc. At the time, Bohr himself did not know why angular momentum should be quantized, but by using that assumption, he was able to calculate the energies in the hydrogen spectrum, something no one else had done at the time.himself did not know why angular momentum should be quantized, but by using that assumption, he was able to calculate the energies in the hydrogen spectrum, something no one else had done at the time.

The nucleus has a positive charge $Z q_{e}$; thus, $V=}{r_{n}}$, recalling an earlier equation for the potential due to a point charge from the chapter on Electricity and Magnetism.

How do we calculate energies in a multiple-electron atom? In the case of characteristic X-rays, the following approximate calculation is reasonable. Characteristic X-rays are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled. Inner-shell electrons are nearer the nucleus than others in an atom and thus feel little net effect from the others. That is similar to what happens inside a charged conductor, where its excess charge is distributed over the surface so that it produces no electric field inside.

Characteristic X-ray energies become progressively larger for heavier elements because their energy increases approximately as $Z^{2}$.

You must remove it from the atom completely. In the case of tungsten, at least $72.5 $ is needed.

There are limits to Bohr's theory. It does not account for the interaction of bound electrons, so it cannot be fully applied to multielectron atoms, even one as simple as the two-electron helium atom. Bohr's model is what we call semiclassical. The orbits are quantized (nonclassical) but are assumed to be simple circular paths (classical). As quantum mechanics was developed, it became clear that there are no well-defined orbits; rather, there are clouds of probability. Additionally, Bohr's theory did not explain that some spectral lines are doublets or split into two when examined closely. While we shall examine a few of those aspects of quantum mechanics in more detail, it should be kept in mind that Bohr did not fail. Rather, he made very important steps along the path to greater knowledge and laid the foundation for all of atomic physics that has since evolved.Rather, he made very important steps along the path to greater knowledge and laid the foundation for all of atomic physics that has since evolved.


Following Bohr's initial work on the hydrogen atom, a decade was to pass before Louis de Broglie proposed that matter has wave properties. The wave-like properties of matter were subsequently confirmed by observations of electron interference when scattered from crystals. Electrons can exist only in locations where they interfere constructively. How does that affect electrons in atomic orbits? When an electron is bound to an atom, its wavelength must fit into a small space, something like a standing wave on a string (see Figure 22.12). Orbits in which an electron can constructively interfere with itself are allowed. All orbits in which constructive interference cannot occur are not able to exist. Thus, only certain orbits are allowed. The wave nature of an electron, according to de Broglie, is why the orbits are quantized!The wave nature of an electron, according to de Broglie, is why the orbits are quantized!

How does determining the location of an electron change its trajectory? The answer is fundamentally important-measurement affects the system being observed. It is impossible to measure a physical quantity exactly, and greater precision in measuring one quantity produces less precision in measuring a related quantity. It was Werner Heisenberg who first stated that limit to knowledge in 1929 as a result of his work on quantum mechanics and the wave characteristics of all particles (see Figure 22.14).It was Werner Heisenberg who first stated that limit to knowledge in 1929 as a result of his work on quantum mechanics and the wave characteristics of all particles (see Figure 22.14).

Figure 22.14 Werner Heisenberg was the physicist who developed the first version of true quantum mechanics. Not only did his work give a description of nature on the very small scale, it also changed our view of the availability of knowledge. Although he is universally recognized for the importance of his work by receiving the Nobel Prize in 1932, for example, Heisenberg remained in Germany during World War II and headed the German effort to build a nuclear bomb, permanently alienating himself from most of the scientific community.

For example, you can measure the position of a moving electron by scattering light or other electrons from it. However, by doing so, you are giving the electron energy, and therefore imparting momentum to it. As a result, the momentum of the electron is affected and cannot be determined precisely. This change in momentum could be anywhere from close to zero up to the relative momentum of the electron $(p  h /  Note that, in this case, the particle is an electron, but the principle applies to any particle. in momentum could be anywhere from close to zero up to the relative momentum of the electron $(p  h /  Note that, in this case, the particle is an electron, but the principle applies to any particle.

Viewing the electron through the model of wave-particle duality, Heisenberg recognized that, because a wave is not located at one fixed point in space, there is an uncertainty associated with any electron's position. That uncertainty in position, $ x$, is approximately equal to the wavelength of the particle. That is, $ x   There is an interesting trade-off between position and momentum. The uncertainty in an electron's position can be reduced by using a shorter-wavelength electron, since $ x   But shortening the wavelength increases the uncertainty in momentum, since $ p  h /  Conversely, the uncertainty in momentum can be reduced by using a longer-wavelength electron, but that increases the uncertainty in position.gth increases the uncertainty in momentum, since $ p  h /  Conversely, the uncertainty in momentum can be reduced by using a longer-wavelength electron, but that increases the uncertainty in position.

Mathematically, you can express the trade-off by multiplying the uncertainties. The wavelength cancels, leavingThe wavelength cancels, leaving

Therefore, if one uncertainty is reduced, the other must increase so that their product is $ h$.

Because of the wave characteristic of matter, the idea of well-defined orbits gives way to a model in which there is a cloud of probability, consistent with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Figure 22.15 shows how the principle applies to the ground state of hydrogen. If you try to follow the electron in some well-defined orbit using a probe that has a wavelength small enough to
measure position accurately, you will instead knock the electron out of its orbit. Each measurement of the electron's position will find it to be in a definite location somewhere near the nucleus. Repeated measurements reveal a cloud of probability like that in the figure, with each speck the location determined by a single measurement. There is not a well-defined, circular-orbit type of distribution.

There is an ongoing quest to find the substructures of matter. At one time, it was thought that atoms would be the ultimate substructure. However, just when the first direct evidence of atoms was obtained, it became clear that they have a substructure and a tiny nucleus. The nucleus itself has spectacular characteristics. For example, certain nuclei are unstable, and their decay emits radiations with energies millions of times greater than atomic energies. Some of the mysteries of nature, such as why the core of Earth remains molten and how the Sun produces its energy, are explained by nuclear phenomena. The exploration of radioactivity and the nucleus has revealed new fundamental particles, forces, and conservation laws. That exploration has evolved into a search for further underlying structures, such as quarks. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of the nucleus and nuclear radioactivity.In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of the nucleus and nuclear radioactivity.


At this point, you are likely familiar with the neutron and proton, the two fundamental particles that make up the nucleus of an atom. Those two particles, collectively called nucleons, make up the small interior portion of the atom. Both particles have nearly the same mass, although the neutron is about two parts in 1,000 more massive. The mass of a proton is equivalent to 1,836 electrons, while the mass of a neutron is equivalent to that of 1,839 electrons. That said, each of the particles is significantly more massive than the electron.That said, each of the particles is significantly more massive than the electron.

When describing the mass of objects on the scale of nucleons and atoms, it is most reasonable to measure their mass in terms of atoms. The atomic mass unit $()$ was originally defined so that a neutral carbon atom would have a mass of exactly $12 $. Given that protons and neutrons are approximately the same mass, that there are six protons and six neutrons in a carbon atom, and that the mass of an electron is minuscule in comparison, measuring this way allows for both protons and neutrons to have masses close to $1 $. Table 22.1 shows the mass of protons, neutrons, and electrons on the new scale.Table 22.1 shows the mass of protons, neutrons, and electrons on the new scale.


For most conceptual situations, the difference in mass between the proton and neutron is insubstantial. In fact, for calculations that require fewer than four significant digits, both the proton and neutron masses may be considered equivalent to one atomic mass unit. However, when determining the amount of energy released in a nuclear reaction, as in Equation 22.40, the difference in mass cannot be ignored.However, when determining the amount of energy released in a nuclear reaction, as in Equation 22.40, the difference in mass cannot be ignored.

Another other useful mass unit on the atomic scale is the $ / $.

To more completely characterize nuclei, let us also consider two other important quantities: the atomic number and the mass number. The atomic number, $Z$, represents the number of protons within a nucleus. That value determines the elemental quality of each atom. Every carbon atom, for instance, has a $Z$ value of 6, whereas every oxygen atom has a $Z$ value of 8 . For clarification, only oxygen atoms may have a $Z$ value of 8 . If the $Z$ value is not 8, the atom cannot be oxygen.If the $Z$ value is not 8, the atom cannot be oxygen.

The mass number, $A$, represents the total number of protons and neutrons, or nucleons, within an atom. For an ordinary carbon atom the mass number would be 12 , as there are typically six neutrons accompanying the six protons within the atom. In the case of carbon, the mass would be exactly $12 $. For oxygen, with a mass number of 16, the atomic mass is $15.994915 $. Of course, the difference is minor and can be ignored for most scenarios. Again, because the mass of an electron is so small compared to the nucleons, the mass number and the atomic mass can be essentially equivalent. Figure 22.16 shows an example of Lithium-7, which has an atomic number of 3 and a mass number of 7 .Figure 22.16 shows an example of Lithium-7, which has an atomic number of 3 and a mass number of 7 .

How does the mass number help to differentiate one atom from another? If each atom of carbon has an atomic number of 6 ,
then what is the value of including the mass number at all? The intent of the mass number is to differentiate between various isotopes of an atom. The term isotope refers to the variation of atoms based upon the number of neutrons within their nucleus. While it is most common for there to be six neutrons accompanying the six protons within a carbon atom, it is possible to find carbon atoms with seven neutrons or eight neutrons. Those carbon atoms are respectively referred to as carbon-13 and carbon-14 atoms, with their mass numbers being their primary distinction. The isotope distinction is an important one to make, as the number of neutrons within an atom can affect a number of its properties, not the least of which is nuclear stability.The isotope distinction is an important one to make, as the number of neutrons within an atom can affect a number of its properties, not the least of which is nuclear stability.

To more easily identify various atoms, their atomic number and mass number are typically written in a form of representation called the nuclide. The nuclide form appears as follows: ${ }_{A}^{Z} X_{N}$, where $X$ is the atomic symbol and $N$ represents the number of neutrons.The nuclide form appears as follows: ${ }_{A}^{Z} X_{N}$, where $X$ is the atomic symbol and $N$ represents the number of neutrons.

Let us look at a few examples of nuclides expressed in the ${ }_{A}^{Z} X_{N}$ notation. The nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, is a single proton, or ${ }_{1}^{1} $ (the zero for no neutrons is often omitted). To check the symbol, refer to the periodic table-you see that the atomic number $Z$ of hydrogen is 1 . Since you are given that there are no neutrons, the mass number $A$ is also 1 . There is a scarce form of hydrogen found in nature called deuterium; its nucleus has one proton and one neutron and, hence, twice the mass of common hydrogen. The symbol for deuterium is, thus, ${ }_{1}^{2} $. An even rarer-and radioactive-form of hydrogen is called tritium, since it has a single proton and two neutrons, and it is written ${ }_{1}^{3} $. The three varieties of hydrogen have nearly identical chemistries, but the nuclei differ greatly in mass, stability, and other characteristics. Again, the different nuclei are referred to as isotopes of the same element.Again, the different nuclei are referred to as isotopes of the same element.

There is some redundancy in the symbols $A, X, Z$, and $N$. If the element $X$ is known, then $Z$ can be found in a periodic table. If both $A$ and $X$ are known, then $N$ can also be determined by first finding $Z$; then, $N=A-Z$. Thus the simpler notation for nuclides isThus the simpler notation for nuclides is

${ }^{A} X$${ }^{A} X$

which is sufficient and is most commonly used. For example, in this simpler notation, the three isotopes of hydrogen are ${ }^{1} $, ${ }^{2} $, and ${ }^{3} $. For ${ }^{238} $, should we need to know, we can determine that $Z=92$ for uranium from the periodic table, and thus, $N$ $=238-92=146$.For ${ }^{238} $, should we need to know, we can determine that $Z=92$ for uranium from the periodic table, and thus, $N$ $=238-92=146$.


In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) noticed something strange. When a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende was placed on a completely opaque envelope containing a photographic plate, it darkened spots on the photographic plate.. Becquerel reasoned that the pitchblende must emit invisible rays capable of penetrating the opaque material. Stranger still was that no light was shining on the pitchblende, which means that the pitchblende was emitting the invisible rays continuously without having any energy input! There is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that scientists can now explain using Einstein's famous equation $E=m c^{2}$. It was soon evident that Becquerel's rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics.It was soon evident that Becquerel's rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics.

To this point, most reactions you have studied have been chemical reactions, which are reactions involving the electrons
surrounding the atoms. However, two types of experimental evidence implied that Becquerel's rays did not originate with electrons, but instead within the nucleus of an atom.However, two types of experimental evidence implied that Becquerel's rays did not originate with electrons, but instead within the nucleus of an atom.

First, the radiation is found to be only associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Whether uranium was in the form of an element or compound was irrelevant to its radiation. In addition, the presence of radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of those factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do.Since all of those factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do.

The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies on the order of $10^{6} $ per event, which is much greater than typical atomic energies that are a few eV, such as those observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic X-rays.per event, which is much greater than typical atomic energies that are a few eV, such as those observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic X-rays.

But why would reactions within the nucleus take place? And what would cause an apparently stable structure to begin emitting energy? Was there something special about Becquerel's uranium-rich pitchblende? To answer those questions, it is necessary to look into the structure of the nucleus. Though it is perhaps surprising, you will find that many of the same principles that we observe on a macroscopic level still apply to the nucleus.Though it is perhaps surprising, you will find that many of the same principles that we observe on a macroscopic level still apply to the nucleus.


A variety of experiments indicate that a nucleus behaves something like a tightly packed ball of nucleons, as illustrated in $}$ 22.17. Those nucleons have large kinetic energies and, thus, move rapidly in very close contact. Nucleons can be separated by a large force, such as in a collision with another nucleus, but strongly resist being pushed closer together. The most compelling evidence that nucleons are closely packed in a nucleus is that the radius of a nucleus, $r$, is found to be approximatelyThe most compelling evidence that nucleons are closely packed in a nucleus is that the radius of a nucleus, $r$, is found to be approximately

That is what you expect if you pack nucleons so close that there is no empty space between them.That is what you expect if you pack nucleons so close that there is no empty space between them.

So what forces hold a nucleus together? After all, the nucleus is very small and its protons, being positive, should exert tremendous repulsive forces on one another. Considering that, it seems that the nucleus would be forced apart, not together!Considering that, it seems that the nucleus would be forced apart, not together!

The answer is that a previously unknown force holds the nucleus together and makes it into a tightly packed ball of nucleons. This force is known as the strong nuclear force. The strong force has such a short range that it quickly fall to zero over a distance of only $10^{-15}$ meters. However, like glue, it is very strong when the nucleons get close to one another.However, like glue, it is very strong when the nucleons get close to one another.

The balancing of the electromagnetic force with the nuclear forces is what allows the nucleus to maintain its spherical shape. If, for any reason, the electromagnetic force should overcome the nuclear force, components of the nucleus would be projected outward, creating the very radiation that Becquerel discovered!If, for any reason, the electromagnetic force should overcome the nuclear force, components of the nucleus would be projected outward, creating the very radiation that Becquerel discovered!

Understanding why the nucleus would break apart can be partially explained using Table 22.2. The balance between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force is a tenuous one. Recall that the attractive strong nuclear force exists between any two nucleons and acts over a very short range while the weaker repulsive electromagnetic force only acts between protons, although over a larger range. Considering the interactions, an imperfect balance between neutrons and protons can result in a nuclear reaction, with the result of regaining equilibrium.Considering the interactions, an imperfect balance between neutrons and protons can result in a nuclear reaction, with the result of regaining equilibrium.

The radiation discovered by Becquerel was due to the large number of protons present in his uranium-rich pitchblende. In short, the large number of protons caused the electromagnetic force to be greater than the strong nuclear force. To regain stability, the nucleus needed to undergo a nuclear reaction called alpha (⿳) decay.To regain stability, the nucleus needed to undergo a nuclear reaction called alpha (⿳) decay.


Radioactivity refers to the act of emitting particles or energy from the nucleus. When the uranium nucleus emits energetic nucleons in Becquerel's experiment, the radioactive process causes the nucleus to alter in structure. The alteration is called radioactive decay. Any substance that undergoes radioactive decay is said to be radioactive. That those terms share a root with the term radiation should not be too surprising, as they all relate to the transmission of energy.That those terms share a root with the term radiation should not be too surprising, as they all relate to the transmission of energy.


Alpha decay refers to the type of decay that takes place when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It is the most common type of decay and causes the nucleus to regain equilibrium between its two competing internal forces. During alpha decay, the nucleus ejects two protons and two neutrons, allowing the strong nuclear force to regain balance with the repulsive electromagnetic force. The nuclear equation for an alpha decay process can be shown as follows.The nuclear equation for an alpha decay process can be shown as follows.

   By ejecting an alpha particle, the original nuclide decreases in atomic number. That means that Becquerel's uranium nucleus, upon decaying, is actually transformed into thorium, two atomic numbers lower on the periodic table! The process of changing elemental composition is called transmutation.Becquerel's uranium nucleus, upon decaying, is actually transformed into thorium, two atomic numbers lower on the periodic table!

   Finally, it is important to see that, despite the elemental change, physical conservation still takes place.

Also, the net charge of all particles involved remains the same before and after the transmutation.Also, the net charge of all particles involved remains the same before and after the transmutation.




Like alpha decay, beta $( decay also takes place when there is an imbalance between neutrons and protons within the nucleus. For beta decay, however, a neutron is transformed into a proton and electron or vice versa. The transformation allows for the total mass number of the atom to remain the same, although the atomic number will increase by one (or decrease by one). Once again, the transformation of the neutron allows for a rebalancing of the strong nuclear and electromagnetic forces. The nuclear

The charges of the three radiated particles differ. Alpha particles, with two protons, carry a net charge of +2 . Beta particles, with one electron, carry a net charge of -1 . Meanwhile, gamma rays are solely photons, or light, and carry no charge. The difference
in charge plays an important role in how the three radiations affect surrounding substances.The difference
in charge plays an important role in how the three radiations affect surrounding substances.

Alpha particles, being highly charged, will quickly interact with ions in the air and electrons within metals. As a result, they have a short range and short penetrating distance in most materials. Beta particles, being slightly less charged, have a larger range and larger penetrating distance. Gamma rays, on the other hand, have little electric interaction with particles and travel much farther. Two diagrams below show the importance of difference in penetration. Table 22.3 shows the distance of radiation penetration, and Figure 22.21 shows the influence various factors have on radiation penetration distance.Table 22.3 shows the distance of radiation penetration, and Figure 22.21 shows the influence various factors have on radiation penetration distance.

The first direct detection of radiation was Becquerel's darkened photographic plate. Photographic film is still the most common detector of ionizing radiation, being used routinely in medical and dental X-rays. Nuclear radiation can also be captured on film, as seen in Figure 22.22. The mechanism for film exposure by radiation is similar to that by photons. A quantum of energy from a radioactive particle interacts with the emulsion and alters it chemically, thus exposing the film. Provided the radiation has more than the few $$ of energy needed to induce the chemical change, the chemical alteration will occur. The amount of film darkening is related to the type of radiation and amount of exposure. The process is not 100 percent efficient, since not all incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change.The process is not 100 percent efficient, since not all incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change.

Another very common radiation detector is the Geiger tube. The clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and documentaries, as well as in our own physics labs, is usually an audio output of events detected by a Geiger counter. These relatively inexpensive radiation detectors are based on the simple and sturdy Geiger tube, shown schematically in Figure 22.23 . A conducting cylinder with a wire along its axis is filled with an insulating gas so that a voltage applied between the cylinder and wire produces almost no current. Ionizing radiation passing through the tube produces free ion pairs that are attracted to the wire and cylinder, forming a current that is detected as a count. Not every particle is detected, since some radiation can pass through without producing enough ionization. However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation.However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation.

Another radiation detection method records light produced when radiation interacts with materials. The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce, such as the phosphor used by Rutherford's group. Materials called scintillators use a more complex process to convert radiation energy into light. Scintillators may be liquid or solid, and they can
be very efficient. Their light output can provide information about the energy, charge, and type of radiation. Scintillator light flashes are very brief in duration, allowing the detection of a huge number of particles in short periods of time. Scintillation detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications. Among those are the detection of the radiation from distant galaxies using satellite-mounted equipment and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories.Among those are the detection of the radiation from distant galaxies using satellite-mounted equipment and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories.

Unstable nuclei decay. However, some nuclides decay faster than others. For example, radium and polonium, discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie, decay faster than uranium. That means they have shorter lifetimes, producing a greater rate of decay. Here we will explore half-life and activity, the quantitative terms for lifetime and rate of decay.Here we will explore half-life and activity, the quantitative terms for lifetime and rate of decay.

Why do we use the term like half-life rather than lifetime? The answer can be found by examining Figure 22.24, which shows how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases with time. The time in which half of the original number of nuclei decay is defined as the half-life, $t_{1 / 2}$. After one half-life passes, half of the remaining nuclei will decay in the next half-life. Then, half of that amount in turn decays in the following half-life. Therefore, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from $N$ to $N /$ 2 in one half-life, to $N / 4$ in the next, to $N / 8$ in the next, and so on. Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process.Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process.


A more precise definition of half-life is that each nucleus has a 50 percent chance of surviving for a time equal to one halflife. If an individual nucleus survives through that time, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through another half-life. Even if it happens to survive hundreds of half-lives, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through one more. Therefore, the decay of a nucleus is like random coin flipping. The chance of heads is 50 percent, no matter what has happened before. The probability concept aligns with the traditional definition of half-life. Provided the number of nuclei is reasonably large, half of the original nuclei should decay during one half-life period.Provided the number of nuclei is reasonably large, half of the original nuclei should decay during one half-life period.

Radioactive dating or radiometric dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity. Its most familiar application is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is an isotope of carbon that is produced when solar neutrinos strike ${ }^{14} $ particles within the atmosphere. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the biosphere, where it is consumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of normal carbon, so if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro's number), you can multiply that number by $1.3  10^{-12}$ to find the number of ${ }^{14} $ nuclei within the object. Over time, carbon-14 will naturally decay back to ${ }^{14} $ with a half-life of 5,730 years (note that this is an example of beta decay). When an organism dies, carbon exchange with the environment ceases, and ${ }^{14} $ is not replenished. By comparing the abundance of ${ }^{14} $ in an artifact, such as mummy wrappings, with the normal abundance in living tissue, it is possible to determine the artifact's age (or time since death). Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples, since the abundance of ${ }^{14} $ nuclei in them is greater.Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples, since the abundance of ${ }^{14} $ nuclei in them is greater.

One of the most famous cases of carbon-14 dating involves the Shroud of Turin, a long piece of fabric purported to be the burial shroud of Jesus (see Figure 22.25). This relic was first displayed in Turin in 1354 and was denounced as a fraud at that time by a French bishop. Its remarkable negative imprint of an apparently crucified body resembles the then-accepted image of Jesus. As a result, the relic has been remained controversial throughout the centuries. Carbon-14 dating was not performed on the shroud until 1988, when the process had been refined to the point where only a small amount of material needed to be destroyed. Samples were tested at three independent laboratories, each being given four pieces of cloth, with only one unidentified piece from the shroud, to avoid prejudice. All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain 92 percent of the ${ }^{14} $ found in living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see Equation 22.57).All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain 92 percent of the ${ }^{14} $ found in living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see Equation 22.57).

Another way of considering the decay constant is that a given carbon-11 nuclei has a 0.0568 percent probability of decaying each second. The decay of carbon-11 allows it to be used in positron emission topography (PET) scans; however, its 20.334 min half-life does pose challenges for its administration.The decay of carbon-11 allows it to be used in positron emission topography (PET) scans; however, its 20.334 min half-life does pose challenges for its administration.

Because 92 percent of the ${ }^{14} $ remains, $N / N_{O}=0.92$. Therefore, the equation $N=N_{O} e^{- t}$ can be used to find $ t$. We also know that the half-life of ${ }^{14} $ is 5,730 years, and so once $ t$ is known, we can find $ and then find $t$ as requested.

This dates the material in the shroud to $1988-690=1300$. Our calculation is only accurate to two digits, so that the year is rounded to 1300 . The values obtained at the three independent laboratories gave a weighted average date of $1320  60$. That uncertainty is typical of carbon-14 dating and is due to the small amount of $14 $ in living tissues, the amount of material available, and experimental uncertainties (reduced by having three independent measurements). That said, is it notable that the carbon-14 date is consistent with the first record of the shroud's existence and certainly inconsistent with the period in which Jesus lived.That said, is it notable that the carbon-14 date is consistent with the first record of the shroud's existence and certainly inconsistent with the period in which Jesus lived.

There are other noncarbon forms of radioactive dating. Rocks, for example, can sometimes be dated based on the decay of ${ }^{238} $. The decay series for ${ }^{238} $ ends with ${ }^{206} $, so the ratio of those nuclides in a rock can be used an indication of how long it has been since the rock solidified.

The previous section dealt with naturally occurring nuclear decay. Without human intervention, some nuclei will change composition in order to achieve a stable equilibrium. This section delves into a less-natural process. Knowing that energy can be emitted in various forms of nuclear change, is it possible to create a nuclear reaction through our own intervention? The answer to this question is yes. Through two distinct methods, humankind has discovered multiple ways of manipulating the atom to release its internal energy.Through two distinct methods, humankind has discovered multiple ways of manipulating the atom to release its internal energy.


In simplest terms, nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic bond. Given that it requires great energy separate two nucleons, it may come as a surprise to learn that splitting a nucleus can release vast potential energy. And although it is true that huge amounts of energy can be released, considerable effort is needed to do so in practice.And although it is true that huge amounts of energy can be released, considerable effort is needed to do so in practice.

An unstable atom will naturally decay, but it may take millions of years to do so. As a result, a physical catalyst is necessary to produce useful energy through nuclear fission. The catalyst typically occurs in the form of a free neutron, projected directly at the nucleus of a high-mass atom.The catalyst typically occurs in the form of a free neutron, projected directly at the nucleus of a high-mass atom.

As shown in Figure 22.26, a neutron strike can cause the nucleus to elongate, much like a drop of liquid water. This is why the model is known as the liquid drop model. As the nucleus elongates, nucleons are no longer so tightly packed, and the repulsive electromagnetic force can overcome the short-range strong nuclear force. The imbalance of forces can result in the two ends of the drop flying apart, with some of the nuclear binding energy released to the surroundings.The imbalance of forces can result in the two ends of the drop flying apart, with some of the nuclear binding energy released to the surroundings.

Figure 22.26 Neutron-induced fission is shown. First, energy is put into a large nucleus when it absorbs a neutron. Acting like a struck liquid drop, the nucleus deforms and begins to narrow in the middle. Since fewer nucleons are in contact, the repulsive Coulomb force is able to break the nucleus into two parts with some neutrons also flying away.Since fewer nucleons are in contact, the repulsive Coulomb force is able to break the nucleus into two parts with some neutrons also flying away.

As you can imagine, the consequences of the nuclei splitting are substantial. When a nucleus is split, it is not only energy that is released, but a small number of neutrons as well. Those neutrons have the potential to cause further fission in other nuclei, especially if they are directed back toward the other nuclei by a dense shield or neutron reflector (see part (d) of Figure 22.26).eutrons have the potential to cause further fission in other nuclei, especially if they are directed back toward the other nuclei by a dense shield or neutron reflector (see part (d) of Figure 22.26).

However, not every neutron produced by fission induces further fission. Some neutrons escape the fissionable material, while others interact with a nucleus without making it split. We can enhance the number of fissions produced by neutrons by having a large amount of fissionable material as well as a neutron reflector. The minimum amount necessary for self-sustained fission of a given nuclide is called its critical mass. Some nuclides, such as ${ }^{239} $, produce more neutrons per fission than others, such as ${ }^{235} $. Additionally, some nuclides are easier to make fission than others. In particular, ${ }^{235} $ and ${ }^{239} $ are easier to fission than the much more abundant ${ }^{238} $. Both factors affect critical mass, which is smallest for ${ }^{239} $.

This depends on several factors, including how many neutrons are produced in an average fission and how easy it is to make a particular type of nuclide fission.This depends on several factors, including how many neutrons are produced in an average fission and how easy it is to make a particular type of nuclide fission.

A chain reaction can have runaway results. If each atomic split results in two nuclei producing a new fission, the number of nuclear reactions will increase exponentially. One fission will produce two atoms, the next round of fission will create four atoms, the third round eight atoms, and so on. Of course, each time fission occurs, more energy will be emitted, further increasing the power of the atomic reaction. And that is just if two neutrons create fission reactions each round. Perhaps you can now see why so many people consider atomic energy to be an exciting energy source!Perhaps you can now see why so many people consider atomic energy to be an exciting energy source!

To make a self-sustained nuclear fission reactor with ${ }^{235} $, it is necessary to slow down the neutrons. Water is very effective at this, since neutrons collide with protons in water molecules and lose energy.

Control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust neutron flux. To produce large amounts of power, reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses, and the chain reaction easily becomes self-sustaining.

Control rods help prevent overheating, perhaps even a meltdown or explosive disassembly. The water that is used to slow down neutrons, necessary to get them to induce fission in ${ }^{235} $, and achieve criticality, provides a negative feedback for temperature increase. In case the reactor overheats and boils the water to steam or is breached, the absence of water kills the chain reaction. Considerable heat, however, can still be generated by the reactor's radioactive fission products. Other safety features, thus, need to be incorporated in the event of a loss of coolant accident, including auxiliary cooling water and pumps.Other safety features, thus, need to be incorporated in the event of a loss of coolant accident, including auxiliary cooling water and pumps.

Recall that, according to Einstein's theory, energy and mass are essentially the same thing. In the case of fission, the mass of the products is less than that of the reactants because the missing mass appears in the form of the energy released in the reaction, with a constant value of $c^{2}$ Joules of energy converted for each kilogram of material. The value of $c^{2}$ is substantial-from Einstein's equation, the amount of energy in just 1 gram of mass would be enough to support the average U.S. citizen for more than 270 years!

The result is another impressively large amount of energy, equivalent to about 14,000 barrels of crude oil or 600,000 gallons of gasoline. But, it is only one fourth the energy produced by the fusion of a kilogram of a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Even though each fission reaction yields about ten times the energy of a fusion reaction, the energy per kilogram of fission fuel is less, because there are far fewer moles per kilogram of the heavy nuclides. Fission fuel is also much scarcer than fusion fuel, and less than 1 percent of uranium (the $235 $ ) is readily usable.Fission fuel is also much scarcer than fusion fuel, and less than 1 percent of uranium (the $235 $ ) is readily usable.

Nuclear fusion is defined as the combining, or fusing, of two nuclei and, the combining of nuclei also results in an emission of energy. For many, the concept is counterintuitive. After all, if energy is released when a nucleus is split, how can it also be released when nucleons are combined together? The difference between fission and fusion, which results from the size of the nuclei involved, will be addressed next.ucleus is split, how can it also be released when nucleons are combined together? The difference between fission and fusion, which results from the size of the nuclei involved, will be addressed next.

Remember that the structure of a nucleus is based on the interplay of the compressive nuclear strong force and the repulsive electromagnetic force. For nuclei that are less massive than iron, the nuclear force is actually stronger than that of the Coulomb force. As a result, when a low-mass nucleus absorbs nucleons, the added neutrons and protons bind the nucleus more tightly. The increased nuclear strong force does work on the nucleus, and energy is released.The increased nuclear strong force does work on the nucleus, and energy is released.

Once the size of the created nucleus exceeds that of iron, the short-ranging nuclear force does not have the ability to bind a nucleus more tightly, and the emission of energy ceases. In fact, for fusion to occur for elements of greater mass than iron, energy must be added to the system! Figure 22.29 shows an energy-mass curve commonly used to describe nuclear reactions. Notice the location of iron (Fe) on the graph. All low-mass nuclei to the left of iron release energy through fusion, while all highmass particles to the right of iron produce energy through fission.All low-mass nuclei to the left of iron release energy through fusion, while all highmass particles to the right of iron produce energy through fission.

Figure 22.29 Fusion of light nuclei to form medium-mass nuclei converts mass to energy, because binding energy per nucleon ( $ / A)$ is greater for the product nuclei. The larger $ / A$ is, the less mass per nucleon, and so mass is converted to energy and released in such fusion reactions.The larger $ / A$ is, the less mass per nucleon, and so mass is converted to energy and released in such fusion reactions.


Just as it is not possible for the elements to the left of iron in the figure to naturally fission, it is not possible for elements to the right of iron to naturally undergo fusion, as that process would require the addition of energy to occur. Furthermore, notice that elements commonly discussed in fission and fusion are elements that can provide the greatest change in binding energy, such as uranium and hydrogen.Furthermore, notice that elements commonly discussed in fission and fusion are elements that can provide the greatest change in binding energy, such as uranium and hydrogen.

The major obstruction to fusion is the Coulomb repulsion force between nuclei. Since the attractive nuclear force that can fuse nuclei together is short ranged, the repulsion of like positive charges must be overcome in order to get nuclei close enough to induce fusion. Figure 22.30 shows an approximate graph of the potential energy between two nuclei as a function of the distance between their centers. The graph resembles a hill with a well in its center. A ball rolled to the left must have enough kinetic energy to get over the hump before it falls into the deeper well with a net gain in energy. So it is with fusion. If the nuclei are given enough kinetic energy to overcome the electric potential energy due to repulsion, then they can combine, release energy, and fall into a deep well. One way to accomplish that end is to heat fusion fuel to high temperatures so that the kinetic energy of thermal motion is sufficient to get the nuclei together.One way to accomplish that end is to heat fusion fuel to high temperatures so that the kinetic energy of thermal motion is sufficient to get the nuclei together.

The solar interior is dense, and the reactions occur deep in the Sun where temperatures are highest. It takes about 32,000 years for the energy to diffuse to the surface and radiate away. However, the neutrinos can carry their energy out of the Sun in less than two seconds, because they interact so weakly with other matter. Negative feedback in the Sun acts as a thermostat to regulate the overall energy output. For instance, if the interior of the Sun becomes hotter than normal, the reaction rate increases, producing energy that expands the interior. The expansion cools it and lowers the reaction rate. Conversely, if the interior becomes too cool, it contracts, increasing the temperature and therefore the reaction rate (see Figure 22.31).

The world was in political turmoil when fission was discovered in 1938. Compounding the troubles, the possibility of a selfsustained chain reaction was immediately recognized by leading scientists the world over. The enormous energy known to be in nuclei, but considered inaccessible, now seemed to be available on a large scale.The enormous energy known to be in nuclei, but considered inaccessible, now seemed to be available on a large scale.

Within months after the announcement of the discovery of fission, Adolf Hitler banned the export of uranium from newly occupied Czechoslovakia. It seemed that the possible military value of uranium had been recognized in Nazi Germany, and that a serious effort to build a nuclear bomb had begun.It seemed that the possible military value of uranium had been recognized in Nazi Germany, and that a serious effort to build a nuclear bomb had begun.

Alarmed scientists, many of whom fled Nazi Germany, decided to take action. None was more famous or revered than Einstein. It was felt that his help was needed to get the American government to make a serious effort at constructing nuclear weapons as a matter of survival. Leo Szilard, a Hungarian physicist who had emigrated to America, took a draft of a letter to Einstein, who, although a pacifist, signed the final version. The letter was for President Franklin Roosevelt, warning of the German potential to build extremely powerful bombs of a new type. It was sent in August of 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland that marked the start of World War II.It was sent in August of 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland that marked the start of World War II.

It was not until December 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, that the United States made a massive commitment to building a nuclear bomb. The top secret Manhattan Project was a crash program aimed at beating the Germans.The top secret Manhattan Project was a crash program aimed at beating the Germans.

It was carried out in remote locations, such as Los Alamos, New Mexico, whenever possible, and eventually came to cost billions of dollars and employ the efforts of more than 100,000 people. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967), a talented physicist, was chosen to head the project. The first major step was made by Enrico Fermi and his group in December 1942, when they completed the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor. This first atomic pile, built in a squash court at the University of Chicago, proved that a fission chain reaction was possible.This first atomic pile, built in a squash court at the University of Chicago, proved that a fission chain reaction was possible.

Plutonium was recognized as easier to fission with neutrons and, hence, a superior fission material very early in the Manhattan Project. Plutonium availability was uncertain, and so a uranium bomb was developed simultaneously. Figure 22.32 shows a guntype bomb, which takes two subcritical uranium masses and shoots them together. To get an appreciable yield, the critical mass must be held together by the explosive charges inside the cannon barrel for a few microseconds. Since the buildup of the uranium chain reaction is relatively slow, the device to bring the critical mass together can be relatively simple. Owing to the fact that the rate of spontaneous fission is low, a neutron source is at the center the assembled critical mass.Owing to the fact that the rate of spontaneous fission is low, a neutron source is at the center the assembled critical mass.

Plutonium's special properties necessitated a more sophisticated critical mass assembly, shown schematically in Figure 22.33. A spherical mass of plutonium is surrounded by shaped charges (high explosives that focus their blast) that implode the plutonium, crushing it into a smaller volume to form a critical mass. The implosion technique is faster and more effective, because it compresses three-dimensionally rather than one-dimensionally as in the gun-type bomb.

Owing to its complexity, the plutonium bomb needed to be tested before there could be any attempt to use it. On July 16, 1945, the test named Trinity was conducted in the isolated Alamogordo Desert in New Mexico, about 200 miles south of Los Alamos (see Figure 22.34). A new age had begun. The yield of the Trinity device was about 10 kilotons (kT), the equivalent of 5,000 of the largest conventional bombs.The yield of the Trinity device was about 10 kilotons (kT), the equivalent of 5,000 of the largest conventional bombs.

Although Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945, Japan had been steadfastly refusing to surrender for many months, resulting large numbers of civilian and military casualties. Invasion plans by the Allies estimated a million casualties of their own and untold losses of Japanese lives. The bomb was viewed as a way to end the war. The first bomb used was a gun-type uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6 by the United States. Its yield of about $15 $ destroyed the city and killed an estimated 80,000 people, with 100,000 more being seriously injured. The second bomb was an implosion-type plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki only three days later. Its 20 -kT yield killed at least 50,000 people, something less than Hiroshima because of the hilly terrain and the fact that it was a few kilometers off target. The Japanese were told that one bomb a week would be dropped until they surrendered unconditionally, which they did on August 14. In actuality, the United States had only enough plutonium for one more bomb, as yet unassembled.In actuality, the United States had only enough plutonium for one more bomb, as yet unassembled.

Knowing that fusion produces several times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission, some scientists pursued the idea of constructing a fusion bomb. The first such bomb was detonated by the United States several years after the first fission bombs, on October 31, 1952, at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. It had a yield of 10 megatons (MT), about 670 times that of the fission bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Soviet Union followed with a fusion device of its own in August 1953, and a weapons race, beyond the aim of this text to discuss, continued until the end of the Cold War.The Soviet Union followed with a fusion device of its own in August 1953, and a weapons race, beyond the aim of this text to discuss, continued until the end of the Cold War.

Of course, not all applications of nuclear physics are as destructive as the weapons described above. Hundreds of nuclear fission power plants around the world attest to the fact that controlled fission is both practical and economical. Given growing concerns over global warming, nuclear power is often seen as a viable alternative to energy derived from fossil fuels.Given growing concerns over global warming, nuclear power is often seen as a viable alternative to energy derived from fossil fuels.



For decades, fusion reactors have been deemed the energy of the future. A safer, cleaner, and more abundant potential source of energy than its fission counterpart, images of the fusion reactor have been conjured up each time the need for a renewable, environmentally friendly resource is discussed. Now, after more than half a century of speculating, some scientists believe that fusion reactors are nearly here.Now, after more than half a century of speculating, some scientists believe that fusion reactors are nearly here.

In creating energy by combining atomic nuclei, the fusion reaction holds many advantages over fission. First, fusion reactions are more efficient, releasing 3 to 4 times more energy than fission per gram of fuel. Furthermore, unlike fission reactions that require heavy elements like uranium that are difficult to obtain, fusion requires light elements that are abundant in nature. The greatest advantage of the fusion reaction, however, is in its ability to be controlled. While traditional nuclear reactors create worries about meltdowns and radioactive waste, neither is a substantial concern with the fusion reaction. Consider that fusion reactions require a large amount of energy to overcome the repulsive Coulomb force and that the byproducts of a fusion reaction are largely limited to helium nuclei.Consider that fusion reactions require a large amount of energy to overcome the repulsive Coulomb force and that the byproducts of a fusion reaction are largely limited to helium nuclei.

In order for fusion to occur, hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium must be acquired. While deuterium can easily be gathered from ocean water, tritium is slightly more difficult to come by, though it can be manufactured from Earth's abundant lithium. Once acquired, the hydrogen isotopes are injected into an empty vessel and subjected to temperature and pressure great enough to mimic the conditions at the core of our Sun. Using carefully controlled high-frequency radio waves, the hydrogen isotopes are broken into plasma and further controlled through an electromagnetic field. As the electromagnetic field continues to exert pressure on the hydrogen plasma, enough energy is supplied to cause the hydrogen plasma to fuse into helium.As the electromagnetic field continues to exert pressure on the hydrogen plasma, enough energy is supplied to cause the hydrogen plasma to fuse into helium.

Once the plasma fuses, high-velocity neutrons are ejected from the newly formed helium atoms. Those high velocity neutrons, carrying the excess energy stored within bonds of the original hydrogen, are able to travel unaffected by the applied magnetic field. In doing so, they strike a barrier around the nuclear reactor, transforming their excess energy to heat. The heat is then harvested to make steam that drives turbines.

Medical ImagingMedical Imaging

A host of medical imaging techniques employ nuclear radiation. What makes nuclear radiation so useful? First, $ radiation can
easily penetrate tissue; hence, it is a useful probe to monitor conditions inside the body. Second, nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in, so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes. When that is done, the compound is said to be tagged. A tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical. Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information. For example, certain drugs are concentrated in inflamed regions of the body, and their locations can aid diagnosis and treatment as seen in Figure 22.37. Another application utilizes a radiopharmaceutical that the body sends to bone cells, particularly those that are most active, to detect cancerous tumors or healing points. Images can then be produced of such bone scans. Clever use of radioisotopes determines the functioning of body organs, such as blood flow, heart muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the thyroid gland. For instance, a radioactive form of iodine can be used to monitor the thyroid, a radioactive thallium salt can be used to follow the blood stream, and radioactive gallium can be used for cancer imaging.r instance, a radioactive form of iodine can be used to monitor the thyroid, a radioactive thallium salt can be used to follow the blood stream, and radioactive gallium can be used for cancer imaging.

Once a radioactive compound has been ingested, a device like that shown in Figure 22.38 is used to monitor nuclear activity. The device, called an Anger camera or gamma camera uses a piece of lead with holes bored through it. The gamma rays are redirected through the collimator to narrow their beam, and are then interpreted using a device called a scintillator. The computer analysis of detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection method is that there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view), because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal.there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view), because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal.

Those $ rays have identical $0.511 $ energies (the energy comes from the destruction of an electron or positron mass) and they move directly away from each other, allowing detectors to determine their point of origin accurately (as shown in Figure 22.40). It requires detectors on opposite sides to simultaneously (i.e., at the same time) detect photons of $0.511 $ energy and utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in SPECT and CT scans. PET is used extensively for diagnosing brain disorders. It can note decreased metabolism in certain regions that accompany Alzheimer's disease. PET can also locate regions in the brain that become active when a person carries out specific activities, such as speaking, closing his or her eyes, and so on.PET can also locate regions in the brain that become active when a person carries out specific activities, such as speaking, closing his or her eyes, and so on.

We hear many seemingly contradictory things about the biological effects of ionizing radiation. It can cause cancer, burns, and hair loss, and yet it is used to treat and even cure cancer. How do we understand such effects? Once again, there is an underlying simplicity in nature, even in complicated biological organisms. All the effects of ionizing radiation on biological tissue can be understood by knowing that ionizing radiation affects molecules within cells, particularly DNA molecules. Let us take a brief look at molecules within cells and how cells operate. Cells have long, double-helical DNA molecules containing chemical patterns called genetic codes that govern the function and processes undertaken by the cells. Damage to DNA consists of breaks in chemical bonds or other changes in the structural features of the DNA chain, leading to changes in the genetic code. In human cells, we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per cell per day. The repair ability of DNA is vital for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code and for the normal functioning of the entire organism. A cell with a damaged ability to repair DNA, which could have been induced by ionizing radiation, can do one of the following:A cell with a damaged ability to repair DNA, which could have been induced by ionizing radiation, can do one of the following:


   The cell can go into an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence.

   The cell can go into unregulated cell division, leading to tumors and cancers.   The cell can go into unregulated cell division, leading to tumors and cancers.



Since ionizing radiation damages the DNA, ionizing radiation has its greatest effect on cells that rapidly reproduce, including most types of cancer. Thus, cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation than normal cells and can be killed by it easily. Cancer is characterized by a malfunction of cell reproduction, and can also be caused by ionizing radiation. There is no contradiction to say that ionizing radiation can be both a cure and a cause.There is no contradiction to say that ionizing radiation can be both a cure and a cause.


Radiotherapy is effective against cancer because cancer cells reproduce rapidly and, consequently, are more sensitive to radiation. The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio, and all radiotherapy techniques are designed to enhance that ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in Figure 22.41. A narrow beam of radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. The technique concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue.The technique concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue.

Another use of radiation therapy is through radiopharmaceuticals. Cleverly, radiopharmaceuticals are used in cancer therapy by tagging antibodies with radioisotopes. Those antibodies are extracted from the patient, cultured, loaded with a radioisotope, and then returned to the patient. The antibodies are then concentrated almost entirely in the tissue they developed to fight, thus localizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. This method is used with radioactive iodine to fight thyroid cancer. While the therapeutic ratio can be quite high for such short-range radiation, there can be a significant dose for organs that eliminate radiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and bladder. As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited by the tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue.As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited by the tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue.


To quantitatively discuss the biological effects of ionizing radiation, we need a radiation dose unit that is directly related to those effects. To do define such a unit, it is important to consider both the biological organism and the radiation itself. Knowing that the amount of ionization is proportional to the amount of deposited energy, we define a radiation dose unit called the rad. It $1 / 100$ of a joule of ionizing energy deposited per kilogram of tissue, which isIt $1 / 100$ of a joule of ionizing energy deposited per kilogram of tissue, which is


1 =0.01  / 

1 =0.01  / 


For example, if a $50.0-$ person is exposed to ionizing radiation over her entire body and she absorbs $1.00 $, then her wholebody radiation dose isFor example, if a $50.0-$ person is exposed to ionizing radiation over her entire body and she absorbs $1.00 $, then her wholebody radiation dose is


(1.00 ) /(50.0 )=0.0200  / =2.00 

(1.00 ) /(50.0 )=0.0200  / =2.00 


If the same $1.00 $ of ionizing energy were absorbed in her $2.00 $ forearm alone, then the dose to the forearm would beIf the same $1.00 $ of ionizing energy were absorbed in her $2.00 $ forearm alone, then the dose to the forearm would be


(1.00 ) /(2.00 )=0.500  / =50.0 

(1.00 ) /(2.00 )=0.500  / =50.0 


and the unaffected tissue would have a zero rad dose. When calculating radiation doses, you divide the energy absorbed by the mass of affected tissue. You must specify the affected region, such as the whole body or forearm in addition to giving the numerical dose in rads. Although the energy per kilogram in $1 $ is small, it can still have significant effects. Since only a few eV cause ionization, just $0.01 $ of ionizing energy can create a huge number of ion pairs and have an effect at the cellular level.Since only a few eV cause ionization, just $0.01 $ of ionizing energy can create a huge number of ion pairs and have an effect at the cellular level.

The effects of ionizing radiation may be directly proportional to the dose in rads, but they also depend on the type of radiation and the type of tissue. That is, for a given dose in rads, the effects depend on whether the radiation is $   $-ray, or some
other type of ionizing radiation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relates to the amount of biological damage that can occur from a given type of radiation and is given in Table 22.4 for several types of ionizing radiation.The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relates to the amount of biological damage that can occur from a given type of radiation and is given in Table 22.4 for several types of ionizing radiation.

   Though both are neutral and have large ranges, neutrons cause more damage than $ rays because neutrons often cause secondary radiation when they are captured.
   Short-range particles such as $ rays have a severely damaging effect to internal anatomy, as their damage is concentrated and more difficult for the biological organism to repair. However, the skin can usually block alpha particles from entering the body.

A final dose unit more closely related to the effect of radiation on biological tissue is called the roentgen equivalent man, or rem.

The large-scale effects of radiation on humans can be divided into two categories: immediate effects and long-term effects. Table 22.5 gives the immediate effects of whole-body exposures received in less than one day. If the radiation exposure is spread out over more time, greater doses are needed to cause the effects listed.

INTRODUCTION Following ideas remarkably similar to those of the ancient Greeks, we continue to look for smaller and smaller structures in nature, hoping ultimately to find and understand the most fundamental building blocks that exist. Atomic physics deals with the smallest units of elements and compounds. In its study, we have found a relatively small number of atoms with systematic properties, and these properties have explained a tremendous range of phenomena. Nuclear physics is concerned with the nuclei of atoms and their substructures. Here, a smaller number of components-the proton and neutron-make up all nuclei. Exploring the systematic behavior of their interactions has revealed even more about matter, forces, and energy. Particle physics deals with the substructures of atoms and nuclei and is particularly aimed at finding those truly fundamental particles that have no further substructure. Just as in atomic and nuclear physics, we have found a complex array of particles and properties with systematic characteristics analogous to the periodic table and the chart of nuclides. An underlying structure is apparent, and there is some reason to think that we are finding particles that have no substructure. Of course, we have been in similar situations before. For example, atoms were once thought to be the ultimate substructures. It is possible that we could continue to find deeper and deeper structures without ever discovering the ultimate substructure-in science there is never complete certainty. See Figure 23.2.See Figure 23.2.

The properties of matter are based on substructures called molecules and atoms. Each atom has the substructure of a nucleus surrounded by electrons, and their interactions explain atomic properties. Protons and neutrons-and the interactions between them-explain the stability and abundance of elements and form the substructure of nuclei. Protons and neutrons are not fundamental-they are composed of quarks. Like electrons and a few other particles, quarks may be the fundamental building blocks of all matter, lacking any further substructure. But the story is not complete because quarks and electrons may have substructures smaller than details that are presently observable.But the story is not complete because quarks and electrons may have substructures smaller than details that are presently observable.

This chapter covers the basics of particle physics as we know it today. An amazing convergence of topics is evolving in particle physics. We find that some particles are intimately related to forces and that nature on the smallest scale may have its greatest influence on the large scale character of the universe.

Despite the apparent complexity within the universe, there remain just four basic forces. These forces are responsible for all interactions known to science: from the very small to the very large to those that we experience in our day-to-day lives. These forces describe the movement of galaxies, the chemical reactions in our laboratories, the structure within atomic nuclei, and the cause of radioactive decay. They describe the true cause behind familiar terms like friction and the normal force. These four basic forces are known as fundamental because they alone are responsible for all observations of forces in nature. The four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.The four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.


The gravitational force is most familiar to us because it describes so many of our common observations. It explains why a dropped ball falls to the ground and why our planet orbits the Sun. It gives us the property of weight and determines much about the motion of objects in our daily lives. Because gravitational force acts between all objects of mass and has the ability to act over large distances, the gravitational force can be used to explain much of what we observe and can even describe the motion of objects on astronomical scales! That said, gravity is incredibly weak compared to the other fundamental forces and is the weakest of all of the fundamental forces. Consider this: The entire mass of Earth is needed to hold an iron nail to the ground. Yet with a simple magnet, the force of gravity can be overcome, allowing the nail to accelerate upward through space.Yet with a simple magnet, the force of gravity can be overcome, allowing the nail to accelerate upward through space.

The electromagnetic force is responsible for both electrostatic interactions and the magnetic force seen between bar magnets. When focusing on the electrostatic relationship between two charged particles, the electromagnetic force is known as the coulomb force. The electromagnetic force is an important force in the chemical and biological sciences, as it is responsible for molecular connections like ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the electromagnetic force is behind the common physics forces of friction and the normal force. Like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force is an inverse square law. However, the electromagnetic force does not exist between any two objects of mass, only those that are charged.However, the electromagnetic force does not exist between any two objects of mass, only those that are charged.

When considering the structure of an atom, the electromagnetic force is somewhat apparent. After all, the electrons are held in place by an attractive force from the nucleus. But what causes the nucleus to remain intact? After all, if all protons are positive, it
makes sense that the coulomb force between the protons would repel the nucleus apart immediately. Scientists theorized that another force must exist within the nucleus to keep it together. They further theorized that this nuclear force must be significantly stronger than gravity, which has been observed and measured for centuries, and also stronger than the electromagnetic force, which would cause the protons to want to accelerate away from each other.y stronger than gravity, which has been observed and measured for centuries, and also stronger than the electromagnetic force, which would cause the protons to want to accelerate away from each other.

The strong nuclear force is an attractive force that exists between all nucleons. This force, which acts equally between protonproton connections, proton-neutron connections, and neutron-neutron connections, is the strongest of all forces at short ranges. However, at a distance of $10^{-13} $, or the diameter of a single proton, the force dissipates to zero. If the nucleus is large (it has many nucleons), then the distance between each nucleon could be much larger than the diameter of a single proton.If the nucleus is large (it has many nucleons), then the distance between each nucleon could be much larger than the diameter of a single proton.

The weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, as seen in the equation ${ }_{Z}^{A} X_{N} _{Z+1}^{A} Y_{N-1}+e+v$. Recall that beta decay is when a beta particle is ejected from an atom. In order to accelerate away from the nucleus, the particle must be acted on by a force. Enrico Fermi was the first to envision this type of force. While this force is appropriately labeled, it remains stronger than the gravitational force. However, its range is even smaller than that of the strong force, as can be seen in Table 23.1. The weak nuclear force is more important than it may appear at this time, as will be addressed when we discuss quarks.The weak nuclear force is more important than it may appear at this time, as will be addressed when we discuss quarks.

Just as it troubled Einstein prior to formulating the gravitational field theory, the concept of forces acting over a distance had greatly troubled particle physicists. That is, how does one proton know that another exists? Furthermore, what causes one proton to make a second proton repel? Or, for that matter, what is it about a proton that causes a neutron to attract? These mysterious interactions were first considered by Hideki Yukawa in 1935 and laid the foundation for much of what we now understand about particle physics.proton that causes a neutron to attract? These mysterious interactions were first considered by Hideki Yukawa in 1935 and laid the foundation for much of what we now understand about particle physics.

Hideki Yukawa's focus was on the strong nuclear force and, in particular, its incredibly short range. His idea was a blend of particles, relativity, and quantum mechanics that was applicable to all four forces. Yukawa proposed that the nuclear force is actually transmitted by the exchange of particles, called carrier particles, and that what we commonly refer to as the force's field consists of these carrier particles. Specifically for the strong nuclear force, Yukawa proposed that a previously unknown particle, called a pion, is exchanged between nucleons, transmitting the force between them. Figure 23.3 illustrates how a pion would carry a force between a proton and a neutron.Figure 23.3 illustrates how a pion would carry a force between a proton and a neutron.

Figure 23.3 The strong nuclear force is transmitted between a proton and neutron by the creation and exchange of a pion. The pion, created through a temporary violation of conservation of mass-energy, travels from the proton to the neutron and is recaptured. It is not
directly observable and is called a virtual particle. Note that the proton and neutron change identity in the process. The range of the force is limited by the fact that the pion can exist for only the short time allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Yukawa used the finite range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion; the shorter the range, the larger the mass of the carrier particle.Yukawa used the finite range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion; the shorter the range, the larger the mass of the carrier particle.

In Yukawa's strong force, the carrier particle is assumed to be transmitted at the speed of light and is continually transferred between the two nucleons shown. The particle that Yukawa predicted was finally discovered within cosmic rays in 1947. Its name, the pion, stands for pi meson, where meson means medium mass; it's a medium mass because it is smaller than a nucleon but larger than an electron. Yukawa launched the field that is now called quantum chromodynamics, and the carrier particles are now called gluons due to their strong binding power. The reason for the change in the particle name will be explained when quarks are discussed later in this section.The reason for the change in the particle name will be explained when quarks are discussed later in this section.

As you may assume, the strong force is not the only force with a carrier particle. Nuclear decay from the weak force also requires a particle transfer. In the weak force are the following three: the weak negative carrier, $$; the weak positive carrier, $$; and the zero charge carrier, $Z^{ As we will see, Fermi inferred that these particles must carry mass, as the total mass of the products of nuclear decay is slightly larger than the total mass of all reactants after nuclear decay.Z^{ As we will see, Fermi inferred that these particles must carry mass, as the total mass of the products of nuclear decay is slightly larger than the total mass of all reactants after nuclear decay.

The carrier particle for the electromagnetic force is, not surprisingly, the photon. After all, just as a lightbulb can emit photons from a charged tungsten filament, the photon can be used to transfer information from one electrically charged particle to another. Finally, the graviton is the proposed carrier particle for gravity. While it has not yet been found, scientists are currently looking for evidence of its existence (see Boundless Physics: Searching for the Graviton).While it has not yet been found, scientists are currently looking for evidence of its existence (see Boundless Physics: Searching for the Graviton).

So how does a carrier particle transmit a fundamental force? Figure 23.4 shows a virtual photon transmitted from one positively charged particle to another. The transmitted photon is referred to as a virtual particle because it cannot be directly observed while transmitting the force. Figure 23.5 shows a way of graphing the exchange of a virtual photon between the two positively charged particles. This graph of time versus position is called a Feynman diagram, after the brilliant American physicist Richard Feynman (1918-1988), who developed it.This graph of time versus position is called a Feynman diagram, after the brilliant American physicist Richard Feynman (1918-1988), who developed it.

The Feynman diagram should be read from the bottom up to show the movement of particles over time. In it, you can see that the left proton is propelled leftward from the photon emission, while the right proton feels an impulse to the right when the photon is received. In addition to the Feynman diagram, Richard Feynman was one of the theorists who developed the field of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which further describes electromagnetic interactions on the submicroscopic scale. For this work, he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S.I. Tomonaga. A Feynman diagram explaining the strong force interaction hypothesized by Yukawa can be seen in Figure 23.6.

The relative masses of the listed carrier particles describe something valuable about the four fundamental forces, as can be seen in Table 23.2. $$ bosons (consisting of $$and $$bosons) and $$ bosons ( $$ bosons), carriers of the weak nuclear force, are nearly 1,000 times more massive than pions, carriers of the strong nuclear force. Simultaneously, the distance that the weak nuclear force can be transmitted is approximately $$ times the strong force transmission distance. Unlike carrier particles, which have a limited range, the photon is a massless particle that has no limit to the transmission distance of the electromagnetic force. This relationship leads scientists to understand that the yet-unfound graviton is likely massless as well.This relationship leads scientists to understand that the yet-unfound graviton is likely massless as well.

From Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation to Einstein's field equations, gravitation has held the focus of scientists for centuries. Given the discovery of carrier particles during the twentieth century, the importance of understanding gravitation has yet again gained the interest of prominent physicists everywhere.Given the discovery of carrier particles during the twentieth century, the importance of understanding gravitation has yet again gained the interest of prominent physicists everywhere.

With carrier particles discovered for three of the four fundamental forces, it is sensible to scientists that a similar particle, titled the graviton, must exist for the gravitational force. While evidence of this particle is yet to be uncovered, scientists are working diligently to discover its existence.While evidence of this particle is yet to be uncovered, scientists are working diligently to discover its existence.

So what do scientists think about the unfound particle? For starters, the graviton (like the photon) should be a massless particle traveling at the speed of light. This is assumed because, like the electromagnetic force, gravity is an inverse square law, $F  }$. Scientists also theorize that the graviton is an electrically neutral particle, as an empty space within the influence of gravity is chargeless.Scientists also theorize that the graviton is an electrically neutral particle, as an empty space within the influence of gravity is chargeless.

However, because gravity is such a weak force, searching for the graviton has resulted in some unique methods. LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is one tool currently being utilized (see Figure 23.7). While searching for a gravitational wave to find a carrier particle may seem counterintuitive, it is similar to the approach taken by Planck and Einstein to learn more about the photon. According to wave-particle duality, if a gravitational wave can be found, the graviton should be present along with it. Predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, scientists have been monitoring binary star systems for evidence of these gravitational waves.Predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, scientists have been monitoring binary star systems for evidence of these gravitational waves.

Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are being used to search for the graviton through high-energy collisions. While scientists at the LHC speculate that the particle may not exist long enough to be seen, evidence of its prior existence, like footprints in the sand, can be found through gaps in projected energy and momentum.s at the LHC speculate that the particle may not exist long enough to be seen, evidence of its prior existence, like footprints in the sand, can be found through gaps in projected energy and momentum.

Before looking at all the particles that make up our universe, let us first examine some of the machines that create them. The fundamental process in creating unknown particles is to accelerate known particles, such as protons or electrons, and direct a beam of them toward a target. Collisions with target nuclei provide a wealth of information, such as information obtained by Rutherford in the gold foil experiment. If the energy of the incoming particles is large enough, new matter can even be created in the collision. The more energy input or $ E$, the more matter $m$ can be created, according to mass energy equivalence $m= E / c^{2}$. Limitations are placed on what can occur by known conservation laws, such as conservation of mass-energy, momentum, and charge. Even more interesting are the unknown limitations provided by nature. While some expected reactions do occur, others do not, and still other unexpected reactions may appear. New laws are revealed, and the vast majority of what we know about particle physics has come from accelerator laboratories. It is the particle physicist's favorite indoor sport.It is the particle physicist's favorite indoor sport.

Our earliest model of a particle accelerator comes from the Van de Graaff generator. The relatively simple device, which you have likely seen in physics demonstrations, can be manipulated to produce potentials as great as 50 million volts. While these machines do not have energies large enough to produce new particles, analysis of their accelerated ions was instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus.While these machines do not have energies large enough to produce new particles, analysis of their accelerated ions was instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus.

Another equally famous early accelerator is the cyclotron, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E.O. Lawrence (1901-1958). Figure 23.8 is a visual representation with more detail. Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric fields to accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during acceleration. This clever arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy with each loop. As a result, greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff generator.As a result, greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff generator.

Figure 23.8 On the left is an artist's rendition of the popular physics demonstration tool, the Van de Graaff generator. A battery (A) supplies excess positive charge to a pointed conductor, the points of which spray the charge onto a moving insulating belt near the bottom. The pointed conductor (B) on top in the large sphere picks up the charge. (The induced electric field at the points is so large that it removes the charge from the belt.) This can be done because the charge does not remain inside the conducting sphere but moves to its outer surface. An ion source inside the sphere produces positive ions, which are accelerated away from the positive sphere to high velocities. On the right is a cyclotron. Cyclotrons use a magnetic field to cause particles to move in circular orbits. As the particles pass between the plates of the Dees, the voltage across the gap is oscillated to accelerate them twice in each orbit.As the particles pass between the plates of the Dees, the voltage across the gap is oscillated to accelerate them twice in each orbit.

A synchrotron is a modification of the cyclotron in which particles continually travel in a fixed-radius orbit, increasing speed each time. Accelerating voltages are synchronized with the particles to accelerate them, hence the name. Additionally, magnetic field strength is increased to keep the orbital radius constant as energy increases. A ring of magnets and accelerating tubes, as shown in Figure 23.9, are the major components of synchrotrons. High-energy particles require strong magnetic fields to steer
them, so superconducting magnets are commonly employed. Still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons need to be very large at very high energies since the radius of a high-energy particle's orbit is very large.Still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons need to be very large at very high energies since the radius of a high-energy particle's orbit is very large.

To further probe the nucleus, physicists need accelerators of greater energy and detectors of shorter wavelength. To do so requires not only greater funding but greater ingenuity as well. Colliding beams used at both the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab; see Figure 23.11) near Chicago and the LHC in Switzerland are designed to reduce energy loss in particle collisions. Typical stationary particle detectors lose a large amount of energy to the recoiling target struck by the accelerating particle. By providing head-on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions, colliding beams make it possible to create particles with momenta and kinetic energies near zero. This allows for particles of greater energy and mass to be created. Figure 23.10 is a schematic representation of this effect. In addition to circular accelerators, linear accelerators can be used to reduce energy radiation losses. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (now called the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) in California is home to the largest such accelerator in the world.The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (now called the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) in California is home to the largest such accelerator in the world.

The search for fundamental particles is nothing new. Atomists of the Greek and Indian empires, like Democritus of fifth century B.C., openly wondered about the most finite components of our universe. Though dormant for centuries, curiosity about the atomic nature of matter was reinvigorated by Rutherford's gold foil experiment and the discovery of the nucleus. By the early 1930s, scientists believed they had fully determined the tiniest constituents of matter-in the form of the proton, neutron, and electron.By the early 1930s, scientists believed they had fully determined the tiniest constituents of matter-in the form of the proton, neutron, and electron.

This would be only partially true. At present, scientists know that there are hundreds of particles not unlike our electron and nucleons, all making up what some have termed the particle zoo. While we are confident that the electron remains fundamental, it is surrounded by a plethora of similar sounding terms, like leptons, hadrons, baryons, and mesons. Even though not every particle is considered fundamental, they all play a vital role in understanding the intricate structure of our universe.Even though not every particle is considered fundamental, they all play a vital role in understanding the intricate structure of our universe.

A fundamental particle is defined as a particle with no substructure and no finite size. According to the Standard Model, there are three types of fundamental particles: leptons, quarks, and carrier particles. As you may recall, carrier particles are responsible for transmitting fundamental forces between their interacting masses. Leptons are a group of six particles not bound by the strong nuclear force, of which the electron is one. As for quarks, they are the fundamental building blocks of a group of particles called hadrons, a group that includes both the proton and the neutron.As for quarks, they are the fundamental building blocks of a group of particles called hadrons, a group that includes both the proton and the neutron.

Now for a brief history of quarks. Quarks were first proposed independently by American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1963. Originally, three quark types—or flavors-were proposed with the names up (u), down $(d)$, and strange $(s)$.Originally, three quark types—or flavors-were proposed with the names up (u), down $(d)$, and strange $(s)$.

At first, physicists expected that, with sufficient energy, we should be able to free quarks and observe them directly. However, this has not proved possible, as the current understanding is that the force holding quarks together is incredibly great and, much like a spring, increases in magnitude as the quarks are separated. As a result, when large energies are put into collisions, other particles are created—but no quarks emerge. With that in mind, there is compelling evidence for the existence of quarks. By 1967, experiments at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory scattering 20-GeV electrons from protons produced results like Rutherford had obtained for the nucleus nearly 60 years earlier. The SLAC scattering experiments showed unambiguously that there were three point-like (meaning they had sizes considerably smaller than the probe's wavelength) charges inside the proton as seen in Figure 23.12. This evidence made all but the most skeptical admit that there was validity to the quark substructure of hadrons.This evidence made all but the most skeptical admit that there was validity to the quark substructure of hadrons.

Figure 23.12 Scattering of high-energy electrons from protons at facilities like SLAC produces evidence of three point-like charges consistent with proposed quark properties. This experiment is analogous to Rutherford's discovery of the small size of the nucleus by scattering $ particles. High-energy electrons are used so that the probe wavelength is small enough to see details smaller than the proton.High-energy electrons are used so that the probe wavelength is small enough to see details smaller than the proton.

The inclusion of the strange quark with Zweig and Gell-Mann's model concerned physicists. While the up and down quarks demonstrated fairly clear symmetry and were present in common fundamental particles like protons and neutrons, the strange quark did not have a counterpart of its own. This thought, coupled with the four known leptons at the time, caused scientists to predict that a fourth quark, yet to be found, also existed.This thought, coupled with the four known leptons at the time, caused scientists to predict that a fourth quark, yet to be found, also existed.

In 1974, two groups of physicists independently discovered a particle with this new quark, labeled charmed. This completed the second exotic quark pair, strange (s) and charmed (c). A final pair of quarks was proposed when a third pair of leptons was discovered in 1975. The existence of the bottom (b) quark and the top (t) quark was verified through experimentation in 1976 and 1995, respectively. While it may seem odd that so much time would elapse between the original quark discovery in 1967 and the verification of the top quark in 1995, keep in mind that each quark discovered had a progressively larger mass. As a result, each new quark has required more energy to discover.As a result, each new quark has required more energy to discover.


Note that a very important tenet of science occurred throughout the period of quark discovery. The charmed, bottom, and top quarks were all speculated on, and then were discovered some time later. Each of their discoveries helped to verify and strengthen the quark model. This process of speculation and verification continues to take place today and is part of what drives physicists to search for evidence of the graviton and Grand Unified Theory.This process of speculation and verification continues to take place today and is part of what drives physicists to search for evidence of the graviton and Grand Unified Theory.

One of the most confounding traits of quarks is their electric charge. Long assumed to be discrete, and specifically a multiple of the elementary charge of the electron, the electric charge of an individual quark is fractional and thus seems to violate a presumed tenet of particle physics. The fractional charge of quarks, which are $ q_{e}$ and $ q_{e}$, are the only structures found in nature with a nonintegral number of charge $q$. However, note that despite this odd construction, the fractional value of the quark does not violate the quantum nature of the charge. After all, free quarks cannot be found in nature, and all quarks are bound into arrangements in which an integer number of charge is constructed. Table 23.3 shows the six known quarks, in addition to their antiquark components, as will be discussed later in this section.Table 23.3 shows the six known quarks, in addition to their antiquark components, as will be discussed later in this section.

While the term flavor is used to differentiate between types of quarks, the concept of color is more analogous to the electric charge in that it is primarily responsible for the force interactions between quarks. Note-Take a moment to think about the electrostatic force. It is the electric charge that causes attraction and repulsion. It is the same case here but with a color charge. The three colors available to a quark are red, green, and blue, with antiquarks having colors of anti-red (or cyan), anti-green (or magenta), and anti-blue (or yellow).The three colors available to a quark are red, green, and blue, with antiquarks having colors of anti-red (or cyan), anti-green (or magenta), and anti-blue (or yellow).

Why use colors when discussing quarks? After all, the quarks are not actually colored with visible light. The reason colors are used is because the properties of a quark are analogous to the three primary and secondary colors mentioned above. Just as different colors of light can be combined to create white, different colors of quark may be combined to construct a particle like a proton or neutron. In fact, for each hadron, the quarks must combine such that their color sums to white! Recall that two up quarks and one down quark construct a proton, as seen in Figure 23.12. The sum of the three quarks' colors-red, green, and blue-yields the color white. This theory of color interaction within particles is called quantum chromodynamics, or QCD. As part of QCD, the strong nuclear force can be explained using color. In fact, some scientists refer to the color force, not the strong force, as one of the four fundamental forces. Figure 23.13 is a Feynman diagram showing the interaction between two quarks by using the transmission of a colored gluon. Note that the gluon is also considered the charge carrier for the strong nuclear force.Note that the gluon is also considered the charge carrier for the strong nuclear force.

Note that quark flavor may have any color. For instance, in Figure 23.13, the down quark has a red color and a green color. In other words, colors are not specific to a particle quark flavor.In other words, colors are not specific to a particle quark flavor.


Particles can be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel between them. All particles (even those that are massless) are affected by gravity since gravity affects the space and time in which particles exist. All charged particles are affected by the electromagnetic force, as are neutral particles that have an internal distribution of charge (such as the neutron with its magnetic moment). Special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces. Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force, whereas leptons are particles that do not. All particles feel the weak nuclear force. This means that hadrons are distinguished by being able to feel both the strong and weak nuclear forces. Leptons and hadrons are distinguished in other ways as well. Leptons are fundamental particles that have no measurable size, while hadrons are composed of quarks and have a diameter on the order of 10 to $15 $. Six particles, including the electron and neutrino, make up the list of known leptons. There are hundreds of complex particles in the hadron class, a few of which (including the proton and neutron) are listed in Table 23.4 .There are hundreds of complex particles in the hadron class, a few of which (including the proton and neutron) are listed in Table 23.4 .

There are many more leptons, mesons, and baryons yet to be discovered and measured. The purpose of trying to uncover the smallest indivisible things in existence is to explain the world around us through forces and the interactions between particles, galaxies and objects.

What internal structure makes a proton so different from an electron? The proton, like all hadrons, is made up of quarks. A few examples of hadron quark composition can be seen in Figure 23.14. As shown, each hadron is constructed of multiple quarks. As mentioned previously, the fractional quark charge in all four hadrons sums to the particle's integral value. Also, notice that the color composition for each of the four particles adds to white. Each of the particles shown is constructed of up, down, and their antiquarks. This is not surprising, as the quarks strange, charmed, top, and bottom are found in only our most exotic particles.This is not surprising, as the quarks strange, charmed, top, and bottom are found in only our most exotic particles.

Arrows represent the spins of the quarks.

You may have noticed that while the proton and neutron in Figure 23.14 are composed of three quarks, both pions are comprised of only two quarks. This refers to a final delineation in particle structure. Particles with three quarks are called baryons. These are heavy particles that can decay into another baryon. Particles with only two quarks-a-quark-anti-quark pair-are called mesons. These are particles of moderate mass that cannot decay into the more massive baryons.These are particles of moderate mass that cannot decay into the more massive baryons.

Before continuing, take a moment to view Figure 23.15. In this figure, you can see the strong force reimagined as a color force. The particles interacting in this figure are the proton and neutron, just as they were in Figure 23.6.

Antimatter was first discovered in the form of the positron, the positively charged electron. In 1932, American physicist Carl Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic ray studies. Through a cloud chamber modified to curve the trajectories of cosmic
rays, Anderson noticed that the curves of some particles followed that of a negative charge, while others curved like a positive charge. However, the positive curve showed not the mass of a proton but the mass of an electron. This outcome is shown in Figure 23.16 and suggests the existence of a positively charged version of the electron, created by the destruction of solar photons.This outcome is shown in Figure 23.16 and suggests the existence of a positively charged version of the electron, created by the destruction of solar photons.

Figure 23.16 The image above is from the Fermilab 15 foot bubble chamber and shows the production of an electron and positron (or antielectron) from an incident photon. This event is titled pair production and provides evidence of antimatter, as the two repel each other.This event is titled pair production and provides evidence of antimatter, as the two repel each other.

Antimatter is considered the opposite of matter. For most antiparticles, this means that they share the same properties as their original particles with the exception of their charge. This is why the positron can be considered a positive electron while the antiproton is considered a negative proton. The idea of an opposite charge for neutral particles (like the neutron) can be confusing, but it makes sense when considered from the quark perspective. Just as the neutron is composed of one up quark and two down quarks (of charge $+$ and $-$, respectively), the antineutron is composed of one anti-up quark and two anti-down quarks (of charge $-$ and $+$, respectively). While the overall charge of the neutron remains the same, its constituent particles do not!While the overall charge of the neutron remains the same, its constituent particles do not!

A word about antiparticles: Like regular particles, antiparticles could function just fine on their own. In fact, a universe made up of antimatter may operate just as our own matter-based universe does. However, we do not know fully whether this is the case. The reason for this is annihilation. Annihilation is the process of destruction that occurs when a particle and its antiparticle interact. As soon as two particles (like a positron and an electron) coincide, they convert their masses to energy through the equation $E=m c^{2}$. This mass-to-energy conversion, which typically results in photon release, happens instantaneously and makes it very difficult for scientists to study antimatter. That said, scientists have had success creating antimatter through highenergy particle collisions. Both antineutrons and antiprotons were created through accelerator experiments in 1956, and an anti-hydrogen atom was even created at CERN in 1995! As referenced in , the annihilation of antiparticles is currently used in medical studies to determine the location of radioisotopes. 1956, and an anti-hydrogen atom was even created at CERN in 1995!

The Standard Model of the atom refers to the current scientific view of the fundamental components and interacting forces of matter. The Standard Model (Figure 23.17) shows the six quarks that bind to form all hadrons, the six lepton particles already considered fundamental, the four carrier particles (or gauge bosons) that transmit forces between the leptons and quarks, and the recently added Higgs boson (which will be discussed shortly). This totals 17 fundamental particles, combinations of which are responsible for all known matter in our entire universe! When adding the antiquarks and antileptons, 31 components make up the Standard Model.

Figure 23.17 shows all particles within the Standard Model of the atom. Not only does this chart divide all known particles by color-coded group, but it also provides information on particle stability. Note that the color-coding system in this chart is separate from the red, green, and blue color labeling system of quarks. The first three columns represent the three families of matter. The first column, considered Family 1, represents particles that make up normal matter, constructing the protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up the common world. Family 2, represented from the charm quark to the muon neutrino, is comprised of particles that are more massive. The leptons in this group are less stable and more likely to decay. Family 3, represented by the third column, are more massive still and decay more quickly. The order of these families also conveniently represents the order in which these particles were discovered.The order of these families also conveniently represents the order in which these particles were discovered.


Look for trends that exist within the Standard Model. Compare the charge of each particle. Compare the spin. How does mass relate to the model structure? Recognizing each of these trends and asking questions will yield more insight into the organization of particles and the forces that dictate particle relationships. Our understanding of the Standard Model is still young, and the questions you may have in analyzing the Standard Model may be some of the same questions that particle physicists are searching for answers to today!ding of the Standard Model is still young, and the questions you may have in analyzing the Standard Model may be some of the same questions that particle physicists are searching for answers to today!

The Higgs BosonThe Higgs Boson

One interesting feature of the Standard Model shown in Figure 23.18 is that, while the gluon and photon have no mass, the Z and $$ bosons are very massive. What supplies these quickly moving particles with mass and not the gluons and photons? Furthermore, what causes some quarks to have more mass than others?What supplies these quickly moving particles with mass and not the gluons and photons? Furthermore, what causes some quarks to have more mass than others?

In the 1960s, British physicist Peter Higgs and others speculated that the $$ and $$ bosons were actually just as massless as the gluon and photon. However, as the $$ and $$ bosons traveled from one particle to another, they were slowed down by the presence of a Higgs field, much like a fish swimming through water. The thinking was that the existence of the Higgs field would slow down the bosons, causing them to decrease in energy and thereby transfer this energy to mass. Under this theory, all particles pass through the Higgs field, which exists throughout the universe. The gluon and photon travel through this field as well but are able to do so unaffected.The gluon and photon travel through this field as well but are able to do so unaffected.

The presence of a force from the Higgs field suggests the existence of its own carrier particle, the Higgs boson. This theorized boson interacts with all particles but gluons and photons, transferring force from the Higgs field. Particles with large mass (like the top quark) are more likely to receive force from the Higgs boson.Particles with large mass (like the top quark) are more likely to receive force from the Higgs boson.

While it is difficult to examine a field, it is somewhat simpler to find evidence of its carrier. On July 4, 2012, two groups of scientists at the LHC independently confirmed the existence of a Higgs-like particle. By examining trillions of proton-proton collisions at energies of 7 to $8 $, LHC scientists were able to determine the constituent particles that created the protons. In this data, scientists found a particle with similar mass, spin, parity, and interactions with other particles that matched the Higgs boson predicted decades prior. On March 13, 2013, the existence of the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed by CERN. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert received the Nobel Prize in 2013 for the "theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin and mass of subatomic particles."Peter Higgs and Francois Englert received the Nobel Prize in 2013 for the "theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin and mass of subatomic particles."

Like Dr. Jackson, successful students of particle physics grow up with a strong curiosity in the world around them and a drive to continually learn more. If you are interested in exploring a career in particle physics, work to achieve good grades and SAT scores, and find time to read popular books on physics topics that interest you.

Present quests to show that the four basic forces are different manifestations of a single unified force that follow a long tradition. In the nineteenth century, the distinct electric and magnetic forces were shown to be intimately connected and are now collectively called the electromagnetic force. More recently, the weak nuclear force was united with the electromagnetic force. As shown in Figure 23.19, carrier particles transmit three of the four fundamental forces in very similar ways. With these considerations in mind, it is natural to suggest that a theory may be constructed in which the strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and electromagnetic forces are all unified. The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), is explored in this section.The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), is explored in this section.

In the 1960s, the electroweak theory was developed by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam. This theory proposed that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are identical at sufficiently high energies. At lower energies, like those in our present-day universe, the two forces remain united but manifest themselves in different ways. One of the main consequences of the electroweak theory was the prediction of three short-range carrier particles, now known as the $W^{+}, W^{-}$, and $$ bosons. Not only were three particles predicted, but the mass of each $$and $$boson was predicted to be $81  / $, and that of the $Z^{0}$ boson was predicted to be $90  / $. In 1983 , these carrier particles were observed at CERN with the predicted characteristics, including masses having those predicted values as given in .In 1983 , these carrier particles were observed at CERN with the predicted characteristics, including masses having those predicted values as given in .

How can forces be unified? They are definitely distinct under most circumstances. For example, they are carried by different particles and have greatly different strengths. But experiments show that at extremely short distances and at extremely high energies, the strengths of the forces begin to become more similar, as seen in Figure 23.20.But experiments show that at extremely short distances and at extremely high energies, the strengths of the forces begin to become more similar, as seen in Figure 23.20.

This diagram is similar to the diagrams in Figure 23.6 and for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces.This diagram is similar to the diagrams in Figure 23.6 and for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces.

As discussed earlier, the short ranges and large masses of the weak carrier bosons require correspondingly high energies to create them. Thus, the energy scale on the horizontal axis of Figure 23.20 also corresponds to shorter and shorter distances
(going from left to right), with $100 $ corresponding to approximately $10^{-18} $, for example. At that distance, the strengths of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are the same. To test this, energies of about $100 $ are put into the system. When this occurs, the $, $, and $$ carrier particles are created and released. At those and higher energies, the masses of the carrier particles become less and less relevant, and the $Z^{0}$ boson in particular resembles the massless, chargeless photon. As further energy is added, the $, $, and $$ particles are further transformed into massless carrier particles even more similar to photons and gluons.As further energy is added, the $, $, and $$ particles are further transformed into massless carrier particles even more similar to photons and gluons.

Figure 23.20 The relative strengths of the four basic forces vary with distance, and, hence, energy is needed to probe small distances. At ordinary energies (a few eV or less), the forces differ greatly. However, at energies available in accelerators, the weak nuclear and electromagnetic (EM) forces become unified. Unfortunately, the energies at which the strong nuclear and electroweak forces become the same are unreachable in any conceivable accelerator. The universe may provide a laboratory, and nature may show effects at ordinary energies that give us clues about the validity of this graph.The universe may provide a laboratory, and nature may show effects at ordinary energies that give us clues about the validity of this graph.

The extremely short distances and high energies at which the electroweak force becomes identical with the strong nuclear force are not reachable with any conceivable human-built accelerator. At energies of about $10^{14} (16,000 $ per particle), distances of about 10 to $30 $ can be probed. Such energies are needed to test the theory directly, but these are about $10^{10}$ times higher than the maximum energy associated with the LHC, and the distances are about 10 to 12 smaller than any structure we have direct knowledge of. This would be the realm of various GUTs, of which there are many, since there is no constraining evidence at these energies and distances. Past experience has shown that anytime you probe so many orders of magnitude further, you find the unexpected.Past experience has shown that anytime you probe so many orders of magnitude further, you find the unexpected.

While direct evidence of a GUT is not presently possible, that does not rule out the ability to assess a GUT through an indirect process. Current GUTs require various other events as a consequence of their theory. Some GUTs require the existence of magnetic monopoles, very massive individual north- and south-pole particles, which have not yet been proven to exist, while others require the use of extra dimensions. However, not all theories result in the same consequences. For example, disproving the existence of magnetic monopoles will not disprove all GUTs. Much of the science we accept in our everyday lives is based on different models, each with their own strengths and limitations. Although a particular model may have drawbacks, that does not necessarily mean that it should be discounted completely.Although a particular model may have drawbacks, that does not necessarily mean that it should be discounted completely.

One consequence of GUTs that can theoretically be assessed is proton decay. Multiple current GUTs hypothesize that the stable proton should actually decay at a lifetime of $10^{31}$ years. While this time is incredibly large (keep in mind that the age of the universe is less than 14 billion years), scientists at the Super-Kamiokande in Japan have used a 50,000-ton tank of water to search for its existence. The decay of a single proton in the Super-Kamiokande tank would be observed by a detector, thereby providing support for the predicting GUT model. However, as of 2014, 17 years into the experiment, decay is yet to be found. This time span equates to a minimum limit on proton life of $5.9  10^{33}$ years. While this result certainly does not support many grand unifying theories, an acceptable model may still exist.While this result certainly does not support many grand unifying theories, an acceptable model may still exist.


The Super-Kamiokande experiment is a clever use of proportional reasoning. Because it is not feasible to test for $10^{31}$ years in order for a single proton to decay, scientists chose instead to manipulate the proton-time ratio. If one proton decays in $10^{31}$
years, then in one year $10^{-31}$ protons will decay. With this in mind, if scientists wanted to test the proton decay theory in one year, they would need $10^{31}$ protons. While this is also unfeasible, the use of a 50,000-ton tank of water helps to bring both the wait time and proton number to within reason.While this is also unfeasible, the use of a 50,000-ton tank of water helps to bring both the wait time and proton number to within reason.


Nature is full of examples where the macroscopic and microscopic worlds intertwine. Newton realized that the nature of gravity on Earth that pulls an apple to the ground could explain the motion of the moon and planets so much farther away. Decays of tiny nuclei explain the hot interior of the Earth. Fusion of nuclei likewise explains the energy of stars. Today, the patterns in particle physics seem to be explaining the evolution and character of the universe. And the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics.And the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics.

In 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that all but the closest galaxies surrounding our own had a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that was proportional to their distance from us. Applying the Doppler Effect, Hubble recognized that this meant that all galaxies were receding from our own, with those farther away receding even faster. Knowing that our place in the universe was no more unique than any other, the implication was clear: The space within the universe itself was expanding. Just like pen marks on an expanding balloon, everything in the universe was accelerating away from everything else.Just like pen marks on an expanding balloon, everything in the universe was accelerating away from everything else.

Extrapolating backward in time, the Big Bang would have occurred between 13 and 15 billion years ago, when all matter would have been at a single point. From this, questions instantly arise. What caused the explosion? What happened before the Big Bang? Was there a before, or did time start then? For our purposes, the biggest question relating to the Big Bang is this: How does the Big Bang relate to the unification of the fundamental forces?ig Bang? Was there a before, or did time start then?

To fully understand the conditions of the very early universe, recognize that as the universe contracts to the size of the Big Bang, changes will occur. The density and temperature of the universe will increase dramatically. As particles become closer together, they will become too close to exist as we know them. The high energies will create other, more unusual particles to exist in greater abundance. Knowing this, let's move forward from the start of the universe, beginning with the Big Bang, as illustrated in Figure 23.22.Knowing this, let's move forward from the start of the universe, beginning with the Big Bang, as illustrated in Figure 23.22.

The Planck Epoch $  10^{-43}  scientists are unable to model the conditions of the Planck Epoch in the laboratory, speculation is that at this time compressed energy was great enough to reach the immense $10^{19} $ necessary to unify gravity with all other forces.

The Inflationary Epoch $  10^{-32}  separation of the strong nuclear force from the electroweak force during this time is thought to have been responsible for the massive inflation of the universe. Corresponding to the steep diagonal line on the left side of Figure 23.22, the universe may have expanded by a factor of $10^{50}$ or more in size. In fact, the expansion was so great during this time that it actually occurred faster than the speed of light! Unfortunately, there is little hope that we may be able to test the inflationary scenario directly since it occurs at energies near $10^{14} $, vastly greater than the limits of modern accelerators.!

The Electroweak Epoch $  10^{-11}  separated from both gravity and the strong nuclear force, the electroweak force exists as a singular force during this time period. As stated earlier, scientists are able to create the energies at this stage in the universe's expansion, needing only $100 $, as shown in Figure 23.20.

As the universe expanded, further eras took place, allowing for the existence of hadrons, leptons, and photons, the fundamental particles of the standard model. Eventually, in nucleosynthesis, nuclei would be able to form, and the basic building blocks of atomic matter could take place. Using particle accelerators, we are very much working backwards in an attempt to understand the universe.
